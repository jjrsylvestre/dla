* Add notation for null space and use it to replace all "the null space of ..." sentence fragments.

* Go through and look for use of | in matrices and replace it by \mathord{|} ?
* Make more use of subsubsection instead of paragraphs ?
* Basis/coords Examples section: add an example of determining coordinates
  relative to a basis of polynomials.
* Need to find another way to do dot product that works both in latex and mathjax
* Look for "<xref .../> of <xref .../>" constructs and replace with text="phrase-global" or text="phrase-hybrid" in
  the first <xref>.
* Consider adding titles to remarks, warnings, etc.
* Look back at old LaTeX book TODO list.
* Go through and check all asides --- having an <aside> inside a <p>
  causes an extra line break in the main text <p>.... which is annoying.
* Go through and see if some sections don't really need to be broken up into
  subsections.
  --> Especially: look for sections that have only one subsection.
  --> Especially: check out theory sections.
* Go through and see where <md>'s need a blank <mrow></mrow> to improve readability.
* Consider changing "A Look Ahead" and "A Look Behind" paragraphs to asides.
* knowl-ize definitions? Would especially be nice to have terminology knowls in activity sets...
  Could add an xml:id to <li>'s in terminology.ptx, then
  search for <term>...</term> to change to an <xref>...</xref>
  ---> see how this is already done for the defintion of linear combination in the vectors chapter.
  ---> would also need to do a bit of re-reading to find places
	that are not currently <term>'s but would benefit from
	having a knowl-ized definition reminder pop up.
* In the Concepts section of det-by-row-red, convert conclusion of each
  "Corresponding elementary matrices" paragraph to an alert, to be in accord
  with the other named paragraphs.
* Look for <paragraphs> and see if <cases> would make more sense.
  (PROBABLY NOT, don't think <cases> is supposed to go outside <proof>.)
* Go through and make xref's to "theorem-*-equiv-to-invertible" point to the most recent
  extended version?
* Consider going through and changing "collection" to "set."
* sed to change xml:id's example-*-examples- to remove redundant -examples-
  (as is already done for theorems/lemmas/propositions that appear in theory sections).

EVENTUALLY:
* Go through and scrutinize aside placements --- they don't have to be inter-paragraph!
* make macros out of more things, to ease change-of-notation for people who want to adopt.
---> for example, get rid of all \left[\begin{array}...\end{array}\right] and similarly for smallmatrix,
     so that matrices can be easily changed from [] to () notation.
---> maybe take this even one step further and get rid of all bmatrix and replace with \left[\begin{matrix} and \end{matrix}\right]  ?
* More liberal use of <sidebyside> to display small figures next to text...?
  But this will be hard to manage good presentation for different size screens...

QUESTIONS FOR rbeezer:
* Can "nearby" references please lose their knowls? (sometimes....)
* <xref ref="...">Rename</xref> does not have the renaming in the knowl.
  This is most obvious in renaming list items --- then the knowl says "Item ???. ..."
  instead of "Rename ???. ..."
* How to start a list at a particular number ?
* <aside> that are two close together interfere.
* Sometimes asides have extra vertical space at the top?
  (See the two asides in activity section for the inverses chapter...)
* Why doesn't <cell> have a top= or left= attribute for borders?

NEW QUESTIONS:
* Capitalize i.e. at the beginning of a sentence
* Pluralization: Remark vs Remarks
* Table of contents stuff:
  --> There is no table of contents in "Front Matter" ?
      (But can go "Up" from Front Matter to a get a listing of parts....)
  --> Collapse section listings and only list chapters in contents side bar?
  --> Have mini table of contents at the top of each section, listing all the subsections?
* <ol cols="2"> goes across first instead of down? (This is noted in the Author's Guide...)
* Misbehaving asides...
  --> see my message to the Support group, as well as the aside
      in "Terminology..." for chapter 14.
  --> Sometimes aside <p> starts inline with <title>, sometimes it starts on the next line.
      (see ch14.activity and ch14.concepts).
  --> Sometimes aside with no title has a blank line at top, sometimes it doesn't.
  --> Sometimes with a long title, when window is made slightly too narrow,
      the title moves onto a second line but the two title lines seem to overlap.
      ---> see the aside in examples section of chapter 14.
* Ragged right vs justify.
* Serif vs non-serif font mismatch.
* An aside inside the statement of a theorem has italicized text?
  (See the first aside next to Proposition 18.5.1.)
* BUG: manually specifying <ol label="alph"> and then having another <ol> nested in an
  <li> of the "alph" list, *without* specifying label type for the sublist, leads to
  sublist with alph labels...
* Inconsistent spacing of <paragraphs>.
* Sometimes extra lines at the end of in-set environments like <example>.
  For example, see the last example in chapter 2.
* BUG: pattern
  (some note in parentheses that ends in <m>math</m>).
  could end up with the ")." on a new line, separated from the math.
  Example: near end of subsection-elem-matrices-examples-elem-matrices-and-inverses.
