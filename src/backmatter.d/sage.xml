<title>Sage Tutorials</title>

<introduction>

<p>
All of the example commands in these tutorials can be run
<ul>
	<li> in a Sage session locally on your computer, </li>
	<li> in a Sage notebook locally on your computer, </li>
	<li>
		in a <url href="https://cocalc.com/">Sage notebook on CoCalc</url>
		(you can link a free account to your Google account if you want to be able to save your work or you can just run an <q>evaluation</q> session),
		or
	</li>
	<li> just in an <url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">online sage cell</url>. </li>
</ul>
Some further notes:
<ul>
	<li>
		If you are using the online Sage cell, you will only get output for your last command.
		To get multiple outputs in one go, use the <c>print</c> command.
	</li>
	<li>
		One advantage of using a Sage session locally on your computer is that you don't have to remember full commands <mdash />
		you can use <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion">tab completion</url> to search for likely commands.
		For example, if <m>A</m> is a matrix and you want to compute its characteristic polynomial,
		you might try the partial command <c>A.char</c> in the Sage command interpreter and hit the tab key.
		The Sage interpreter will then prompt you with likely commands that start with <c>char</c> and can be applied to a matrix.
	</li>
</ul>
