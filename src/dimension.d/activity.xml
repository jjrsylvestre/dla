  <postlude><p>
    We've been using the word <q>dimension</q> informally throughout our developlment of the concepts of vectors (<eg /> calling vectors in <m>\R^2</m> <em>two-dimensional</em> vectors), but finally we can match our intuition about the <q>dimension</q> of the various types of subspaces of <m>\R^3</m> with the theoretical concepts of <term>linear independence</term> and <term>spanning</term> to make the following definition.
    <dl><li>
      <title>dimension of a vector space</title>
      <p> the number of vectors required in a basis for that space </p>

<activity xml:id="activity-dimension-basis-via-parameters">
  <prelude>
  <p>
  One way to obtain a basis for a space (and hence to determine its dimension) is to <em>assign parameters</em> <mdash /> then each <em>independent</em> parameter corresponds to a basis vector.
  </p><p>
  For example, in <m>\R^2</m> we have natural parameters associated to the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-coordinates: <m>\uvec{x} = (x,y)</m>. Expanding this into a linear combination, we get <m>\uvec{x} = x(1,0) + y(0,1)</m>. Parameter <m>x</m> corresponds to basis vector <m>(1,0)</m> and parameter <m>y</m> corresponds to basis vector <m>(0,1)</m>, and together they form a basis <m>\{(1,0),(0,1)\}</m> for <m>\R^2</m>. (In fact, the <term>standard basis</term> for <m>\R^2</m>!). Since there were <em>two</em> independent parameters required to described an arbitrary vector in the space, this led to <em>two</em> basis vectors, and so the dimension of <m>\R^2</m> is (unsurprisingly) <m>2</m>.
  </p>
  <paragraphs><title>Step-by-step procedure</title><p><ol>
    <li> Express an arbitrary element in the space in terms of parameters. </li>
    <li> Use any extra conditions to reduce to the minimum number of <em>independent</em> parameters (if necessary). </li>
    <li> Split up your parametric vector description into a linear combination based on the remaining parameters. </li>
    <li> Extract the basis vector attached to each parameter. </li>
    <li> Count the basis vectors to determine the dimension of the space (which should also correspond to the initial number of independent parameters required). </li>
  </ol></p></paragraphs>
  </prelude>
  <statement>

	In each of the following, determine a basis for the given space using the parameter method outlined above, similarly to the provided <m>\R^2</m> example. Then count the dimension of the space.

  <prelude><p>
  A vector space is called <term>finite-dimensional</term> if it can be spanned by a finite set; otherwise, it is called <term>infinite-dimensional</term>. For example, <m>\R^n</m> is finite-dimensional for each value of <m>n</m>, because it can be spanned by the finite set of standard basis vectors <m>\{\uvec{e}_1,\uvec{e}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{e}_n\}</m>.
  </p></prelude>
  <statement><p>
  Is the vector space of all polynomials is finite- or infinite-dimensional?

<activity xml:id="activity-dimension-enlarge-indep">
  <prelude><p>
  We've already seen that a linearly dependent spanning set can be reduced to a basis
  (<xref ref="proposition-basis-coords-reduce-span-to-basis" />).
  Working the other way, we will use
  <xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-expand-indep" />
  to argue in
  <xref ref="subsection-dimension-theory-linear-indep-consequences" />
  that a linearly independent set that is not a spanning set can be <em>built up</em> to a basis by including additional vectors (<xref ref="proposition-dimension-increase-indep-to-basis" />).
  <xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-expand-indep" /> tells us exactly how to do this: to ensure linear independence at each step, the new vector to be included should not be in the span of the old (<ie /> the new should not be any linear combination of the old).
  </p></prelude>
  <statement>
  <p>
  In each of the following, build the given linearly independent set into a basis for the space.
	<ol label="alph">
	  <li> <m>V=\R^3</m>,  <m>S = \{(1,1,0),(1,0,1)\}</m>. </li>
		<li xml:id="activity-dimension-enlarge-indep-matrices">
		<m>V = M_{22}</m>,
	  <m>
  		S = \left\{\;
    		\left[\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \amp 1\\1 \amp 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right],\;\;
    		\left[\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \amp 0\\1 \amp -1 \end{smallmatrix}\right]
  		\;\right\}
  	</m>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  </statement>
  <hint><p>
  Since we now know the dimensions of these spaces, we know how many linearly independent vectors are required to form a basis. Just guess <em>simple</em> new vectors to include in the given set, one at a time, and for each make sure your new vector is not a linear combination of the vectors you already have (by trying to solve an appropriate system of linear equations.)

    What is the relationship between <m>\dim W</m> and <m>\dim V</m>? Justify your answer in terms of the <em>definition</em> of dimension.
