<introduction><p>
	Here we will recap all of the facts we discussed in <xref ref="section-det-by-row-red-concepts" />, as well as add in a fact from <xref ref="activity-det-by-row-red-det-row-zeros" />. We have already adequately discussed the ideas behind most of these facts, so for most of them we will not include a proof.

<title>Effect of row operations on the determinant</title>

<p>We begin by recording a fact that helped us in our exploration of the effect of swapping rows on the determinant.</p>

<lemma xml:id="lemma-det-by-row-red-odd-adj-row-swaps">

	<statement><p>
	Any row swap can be achieved by a sequence of an <em>odd</em> number of adjacent row swaps.
	</p></statement>

	<proof><title>Proof idea</title><p>
	Suppose you want to swap rows <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m> in a matrix using only adjacent row swaps, where <m>R</m> appears higher in the matrix than <m>R'</m>, and they are separated by <m>m</m> other rows. First move <m>R</m> down to the position just above <m>R'</m>, then swap <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m> (which are now adjacent), then move <m>R'</m> up to the original position of <m>R</m>. Count the number of adjacent swaps that have been made as an expression in <m>m</m>, and notice that it is odd.
	</p></proof>

	<!-- Detailed proof, if desired... -->
	<!--<proof><p>
	Suppose we want to swap two rows <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m> in a matrix, where <m>R</m> appears somewhere above <m>R'</m>, and there are <m>m</m> other rows between them. \begin{inlinenote}We will label these rows as <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m>, even after we have moved them around.\end{inlinenote} Since there are <m>m</m> rows below <m>R</m> before <m>R'</m> appears, by swapping <m>R</m> with the row immediately below it <m>m</m> times, we will end up with <m>R</m> immediately above <m>R'</m> then one more adjacent swap gets <m>R'</m> above <m>R</m>.

	We can reverse what we initially did with <m>R</m> but with <m>R'</m>.

		\end{bmatrix}
	</me>
	We have now swapped the positions of <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m>, the <m>m</m> rows between them are still in their original order, and we achieved it with <m>m+1+m = 2m+1</m> adjacent row swaps. And since <m>2m</m> is even, <m>2m+1</m> is odd.

</lemma>

<p>Here are all the things we learned in our activities in <xref ref="section-det-by-row-red-activities" />.</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-det-by-row-red-det-vs-row-ops">
	<statement><p>
	The following are true for every square matrix.
	<ol>
		<li> If there is a row of zeros, then the determinant is <m>0</m>. </li>
		<li xml:id="proposition-det-by-row-red-det-vs-row-ops-swap">
		If two rows are swapped, then <m>\det(\text{new matrix}) = -\det(\text{old matrix})</m>.

		<li> If there are two identical rows, then the determinant is <m>0</m>. </li>
		<li xml:id="proposition-det-by-row-red-det-vs-row-ops-mult-row">
		If a row is multiplied by constant <m>k</m>, then <m>\det(\text{new matrix}) = k\det(\text{old matrix})</m>.
		</li>
		<li> If a whole matrix <m>A</m> is scalar multiplied by a constant <m>k</m>, then <m>\det (kA) = k^n\det A</m>, where <m>n</m> is the size of the matrix. </li>

		<li> If a multiple of one row is added to another row, then <m>\det(\text{new matrix}) = \det(\text{old matrix})</m>. </li>
	</ol>
	</p></statement>
</proposition>

<p>And here are our connections between rows and columns with respect to the determinant.</p>

<lemma><statement><p>
	For every square matrix <m>A</m>, <m>\det(\utrans{A}) = \det A</m>.
</p></statement></lemma>

<proposition><statement><p>
	The statements of <xref ref="proposition-det-by-row-red-det-vs-row-ops" /> remain true when every instance of the word <q>row</q> is replaced by the word <q>column.</q>
