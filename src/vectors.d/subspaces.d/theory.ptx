			</li>
		</ol>
	</p></statement>

	<proof>

		<p>
		Suppose we have a subcollection of vectors in a vector space that satisfies the three conditions of the Subspace Test.
		We would like to verify that this subcollection is a vector space all on its own,
		using the same vector addition and scalar multiplication operations as the larger space.
		But as explored in
		<xref ref="activity-subspaces-subspace-test-precursor" />
		and discussed in
		<xref ref="subsection-subspaces-concepts-recognizing" />,
		we don't need to verify all ten vector space axioms <mdash />
		we get the six algebra axioms for free from knowing that is how vector algebra works in the larger space.
		The remaining four axioms are
		<xref ref="list-abstract-vec-spaces-concepts-add-axioms-closed" text="local">Axiom A</xref>,
		<xref ref="list-abstract-vec-spaces-concepts-add-axioms-zero" text="local">Axiom A</xref>,
		<xref ref="list-abstract-vec-spaces-concepts-add-axioms-neg" text="local">Axiom A</xref>,
		and
		<xref ref="list-abstract-vec-spaces-concepts-smul-axioms-closed" text="local">Axiom S</xref>,
		so we really only need to verify that the subcollection contains the zero vector,
		and is closed under vector addition, scalar multiplication, and taking negatives.
		Furthermore, from
		<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-test-add-closed">Condition</xref>
		and
		<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-test-smul-closed">Condition</xref>
		of the test, we already know that the subcollection is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
		So we are down to checking the zero vector and negatives.
		</p>

		<p>
		To show that the subcollection must contain the zero vector, consider that
		<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-test-nonempty">Condition</xref>
		of the test guarantees that the subcollection contains <em>some</em> vector <m>\uvec{v}</m>.
		But then
		<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-test-smul-closed">Condition</xref>
		of the test tells us that the subcollection must also contain every scalar multiple of <m>\uvec{v}</m>.
		In particular, the subcollection must contain <m>0\uvec{v} = \zerovec</m>, as desired.
		</p>

		<aside><title>See</title><p>
			<xref ref="proposition-abstract-vec-spaces-basic-vec-props-zero-scalar-mul">Rule</xref>
			of
			<xref ref="proposition-abstract-vec-spaces-basic-vec-props" />.
		</p></aside>

		<p>
		To show that the subcollection must be closed under taking negatives, consider a vector <m>\uvec{w}</m> in the subcollection.
		Again,
		<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-test-nonempty">Condition</xref>
		of the test says that the subcollection must also contain every scalar multiple of <m>\uvec{w}</m>.
		In particular, the subcollection must contain <m>(-1)\uvec{w} = -\uvec{w}</m>, as desired.
		</p>

		<aside><title>See</title><p>
			<xref ref="proposition-abstract-vec-spaces-basic-vec-props-neg-eq-scalar-mul">Rule</xref>
			of
			<xref ref="proposition-abstract-vec-spaces-basic-vec-props" />.
		</p></aside>

		<p>
		Finally, we will consider the <q>only if</q> part of the statement.
		Suppose we have a subcollection of vectors in a vector space that we already know is a subspace.
		A subspace is itself a vector space, so it must be nonempty
		(since it at least contains <em>some</em> zero vector by
		<xref ref="list-abstract-vec-spaces-concepts-add-axioms-zero" text="local">Axiom A</xref>),
		it must be closed under vector addition
		(<xref ref="list-abstract-vec-spaces-concepts-add-axioms-closed" text="local">Axiom A</xref>),
		and it must be closed under scalar multiplication
		(<xref ref="list-abstract-vec-spaces-concepts-smul-axioms-closed" text="local">Axiom S</xref>).
		In other words, it must pass the Subspace Test.
		</p>

</proof>

</proposition>

<p>
As per the proposition above, every subspace satisfies the conditions of the <xref ref="procedure-subspaces-concepts-test" text="title" />.
But we can go a little further.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-subspaces-props">

	<title>Properties of subspaces</title>

	<statement><p>
		Every subspace of a vector space contains the zero vector of that space,
		and is closed under
		vector addition,
		scalar multiplication,
		taking negatives, and
		taking linear combinations.
	</p></statement>

	<proof>

		<p>
		We have already established that a subspace is closed under the vector operations.
		Verifying that it also contains the zero vector and is closed under taking negatives is exactly as in the proof of <xref ref="proposition-subspaces-test" /> above,
		since we know that a subspace always passes the Subspace Test.
		</p>

		<p>
		It remains to show that a subspace is closed under linear combinations.
		So suppose that
		<m>\uvec{v}_1,\uvec{v}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{v}_\ell</m>
		are vectors in the subspace.
		Since the subspace is closed under scalar multiplication, the vectors
		<m>k_1\uvec{v}_1,k_2\uvec{v}_2,\dotsc,k_\ell\uvec{v}_\ell</m>
		are all also in the subspace.
		And then, since the subspace is also closed under addition, the linear combination
		<m>k_1\uvec{v}_1 + k_2\uvec{v}_2 + \dotsb + k_\ell\uvec{v}_\ell</m>
		is also in the subspace.
		</p>

	</proof>

</proposition>

<p>
From the first property of subspaces listed above, we can deduce our observation about the best way to verify
<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-test-nonempty">Condition</xref> of the Subspace Test.
</p>

<corollary><title> Subspaces must contain the zero vector </title><p>
	If a subcollection of a vector space does <em>not</em> contain the zero vector of the larger space, then it cannot be a subspace.

		</li>
	</ol></p></statement>

	<proof>
		<title>Proof of <xref ref="proposition-subspaces-span-subspace-is-subspace">Statement</xref></title>

		<p>
		Recall that <m>\Span S</m> is the collection of all possible linear combinations of vectors in <m>S</m>.
		First we verify that <m>\Span S</m> contains every vector in <m>S</m>.
		Indeed, if <m>\uvec{v}</m> is a vector in <m>S</m>,
		then it is trivially a linear combination of vectors in <m>S</m> by <m>\uvec{v} = 1\uvec{v}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Let <m>V</m> represent the vector space from which the collection of vectors <m>S</m> is taken.
		First, we know that every vector in <m>\Span S</m> is a vector in <m>V</m>,
		because the vectors in <m>\Span S</m> are linear combinations of the vectors in <m>S</m>,
		and <m>V</m> is closed under taking linear combinations
		(<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-props" />,
		where <m>V</m> is considered as a subspace of itself using
		<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-trivial-and-full"/>).
		So <m>\Span S</m> is a subcollection of <m>V</m>.
		</p>

		<p> Now let's apply the <xref ref="procedure-subspaces-concepts-test" text="title" /> to <m>\Span S</m>. </p>

		<case>
			<title><xref ref="procedure-subspaces-concepts-test-nonempty" text="title" /></title>
			<p> We know <m>\Span S</m> is nonempty because it contains each of the vectors of <m>S</m>. </p>
		</case>

		<case>
			<title><xref ref="procedure-subspaces-concepts-test-add-closed" text="title" /></title>
			<p>
			Suppose <m>\uvec{u}</m> and <m>\uvec{v}</m> are vectors in <m>\Span S</m>.
			Then each is a linear combination of vectors in <m>S</m>, say
			<md>
				<mrow> \uvec{u} \amp= k_1 \uvec{u}_1 + k_2 \uvec{u}_2 + \dotsb + k_s \uvec{u}_s, </mrow>
				<mrow> \uvec{v} \amp= m_1 \uvec{v}_1 + m_2 \uvec{v}_2 + \dotsb + m_t \uvec{v}_t, </mrow>
			</md>
			where each of <m>\uvec{u}_1,\uvec{u}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{u}_s</m> and <m>\uvec{v}_1,\uvec{v}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{v}_t</m> are vectors in <m>S</m>.
			Then,
			<md>
				<mrow> \uvec{u} + \uvec{v} \amp = k_1 \uvec{u}_1 + k_2 \uvec{u}_2 + \dotsb + k_s \uvec{u}_s </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp\phantom{=} \quad {} + m_1 \uvec{v}_1 + m_2 \uvec{v}_2 + \dotsb + m_t \uvec{v}_t </mrow>
			</md>,
			which is again a linear combination of vectors in <m>S</m>, so <m>\uvec{u}+\uvec{v}</m> is also in <m>\Span S</m>.
			This shows that <m>\Span S</m> is closed under vector addition.
			</p>
		</case>

		<case>
			<title><xref ref="procedure-subspaces-concepts-test-smul-closed" text="title" /></title>
			<p>
			Suppose <m>\uvec{v}</m> is a vector in <m>\Span S</m>.
			Then it is a linear combination of vectors in <m>S</m>, say
			<me> \uvec{v} = m_1\uvec{v}_1 + m_2\uvec{v}_2 + \dotsb + m_\ell\uvec{v}_\ell </me>,
			where each of <m>\uvec{v}_1,\uvec{v}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{v}_\ell</m> are vectors in <m>S</m>.
			Then for every scalar <m>k</m>,
			<md>
				<mrow> k\uvec{v} \amp = k (m_1 \uvec{v}_1 + m_2 \uvec{v}_2 + \dotsb + m_t \uvec{v}_\ell) </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp = k m_1 \uvec{v}_1 + k m_2 \uvec{v}_2 + \dotsb + k m_\ell \uvec{v}_\ell, </mrow>
			</md>
			which is again a linear combination of vectors in <m>S</m>, so <m>k\uvec{v}</m> is always also in <m>\Span S</m>.
			This shows that <m>\Span S</m> is closed under scalar multiplication.
			</p>
		</case>

		<case><title>Conclusion</title><p>
			Since <m>\Span S</m> passes the Subspace Test, it is a subspace of <m>V</m>.
		</p></case>

	</proof>

	<proof>
		<title>Proof of <xref ref="proposition-subspaces-span-subspace-is-smallest">Statement</xref></title>

		<p>
		We wish to show that every other subspace that contains the vectors of <m>S</m> must also contain <m>\Span S</m> as a subspace.
		So suppose we have another subspace that contains the vectors of <m>S</m>.
		Then it must contain every linear combination of the vectors in <m>S</m>,
		since subspaces are closed under taking linear combinations
		(<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-props" />).
		That is, if a subspace contains all of the vectors in <m>S</m>,
		then it must also contain all of the vectors in <m>\Span S</m>.
		</p>

		<paragraphs><title>Note</title><p>
			There is no need to use the Subspace Test to prove that <m>\Span S</m> is a subspace of this other subspace <mdash />
			we already know from <xref ref="proposition-subspaces-span-subspace-is-subspace">Statement</xref> that <m>\Span S</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>,
			the vector space from which the vectors <m>S</m> are taken.
			So <m>\Span S</m> is a vector space all on its own, hence will be a subspace of <em>any</em> space that contains all of its vectors.

	<proof><title>Proof of <xref ref="proposition-subspaces-span-subspace-full">Statement</xref></title><p>
		A vector space <m>V</m> always has an obvious spanning set <mdash /> itself!
		That is, we claim that <m>V = \Span V</m> is always true.
		To verify this, we must demonstrate that each vector in the collection <m>V</m> is also in the collection <m>\Span V</m>, and vice versa,
		so that they are exactly the same collection of vectors.
		However, by applying
		<xref ref="proposition-subspaces-span-subspace-is-subspace">Statement</xref> we can immediately say that <m>\Span V</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>
		(implying every vector in <m>\Span V</m> is in <m>V</m>) that contains every vector of the spanning set <m>V</m>
		(<ie /> every vector in <m>V</m> is in <m>\Span V</m>).
