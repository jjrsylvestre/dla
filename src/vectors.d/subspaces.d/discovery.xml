<title>Discovery guide</title>

<introduction><p>
	Recall that a <term>vector space</term> is a collection of objects (called <term>vectors</term>) that satisfies all of the axioms in
	<xref ref="definition-abstract-vec-spaces-concepts-abstract-vec-space"/>.
</p></introduction>


<activity xml:id="activity-subspaces-subspace-test-precursor">

	<introduction>

		<p>
		Sometimes you have a subcollection of vectors inside a larger vector space,
		and would like to know whether the subcollection is also a vector space, all on its own.
		</p>

		<aside><title>Definition</title><p>
			A <term>subcollection</term> is a collection of objects, each of which is a member of some <q>larger</q> collection.
			For example, the collection of even numbers is a subcollection of the collection of whole numbers.
		</p></aside>

	</introduction>

	<task>

		<statement><p>
			In the large vector space, you would already <em>know</em> (from having checked) that <em>all</em> ten axioms are true.
			Because all the vectors in the subcollection also <q>live</q> in the large vector space,
			<em>six</em> of the axioms will automatically be true for the subcollection
			(and the remaining four may or may not be true).
			Identify these six axioms that are automatically true.
		</p></statement>

		<hint><p> It is easier to identify the six that are <em>definitely</em> true rather than the four that <em>might</em> be false. </p></hint>

	</task>

	<task>

		<introduction><p>
			Using <m>\R^2</m> as the large vector space, for each of the following subcollections,
			which of those four remaining axioms are true and which are false?
			(Consider all vectors as positioned with initial point at the origin.)
		</p></introduction>

		<task><p> All points on the line <m>y=x</m>. </p></task>

		<task><p> All points on the line <m>y=x+1</m>. </p></task>

	<prelude>

		<p>
		In <xref ref="proposition-subspaces-test" />, we will prove that the task of checking the four <q>possibly false</q> axioms you identified in
		<xref ref="activity-subspaces-subspace-test-precursor"/>
		for a particular subcollection can be refined to the following test.

		<paragraphs><title>The Subspace Test</title><idx><h>Subspace Test</h></idx><idx><h>subspace</h><h>test</h></idx>
			<p><ol label="(i)">
				<li> the subcollection contains at least one vector, </li>
				<li> the sum of two vectors in the subcollection is always equal to another vector <em>in the subcollection</em>, and </li>
				<li> a scalar multiple of a vector in the subcollection is always equal to another vector <em>in the subcollection</em>. </li>
			</ol></p>

	</prelude>

	<introduction>

		<p>
		In each of the following, check each part of the Subspace Test for subcollection <m>W</m> inside vector space <m>V</m>.
		<ul>
			<li> If you think a part of the Subspace Test is <em>true</em>, <alert>justify it without resorting to examples</alert>. </li>
			<li> If you think a part of the Subspace Test is <em>false</em>, <alert>provide an explicit example that demonstrates it</alert>. </li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<aside><title>Logic 101</title><p>
			To demonstrate that a general statement is true, we work in the abstract with <em>arbitrary</em> objects,
			so that our justification is valid no matter what objects one considers.
			But to demonstrate that a general statement is false, all we have to do is demonstrate a specific <term>counterexample</term>,
			because one exception is all that is needed to prove the general rule to be false.

		<paragraphs><title>Hint</title><p>
		Don't guess at it, set up equations and solve!
		The unknowns in your equations will be the scalars in the linear combination of the <m>S</m>-vectors to try to make the vector <m>\uvec{v}</m>.
		Start with a vector equation
		<me> \uvec{v} = \text{linear combination of }S\text{-vectors with variables as scalars} </me>.
		This should somehow lead to a (gasp!) system of linear equations in your unknown scalars.
