<title>Vectors in <m>\R^n</m></title>

<p>
Following <xref ref="activity-vectors-directed-line-segments" />,
consider the vector <m>\uvec{v}</m> in <m>\R^2</m>
(that is, in the plane)
that represents changing position from <m>P(1,2)</m> to <m>Q(3,-1)</m>.

</image>

<p>
We can compute the components of <m>\uvec{v}</m> by computing the change in <m>x</m> and the change in <m>y</m> in moving from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>:
<me> \uvec{v} = (\Delta x,\Delta y) = (3-1,-1-2) = (2,-3) </me>.
We can see by looking at their coordinates that moving from point <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> requires
moving <m>2</m> units right to get from <m>x=1</m> to <m>x=3</m>
and
moving <m>3</m> units down to get from <m>y=2</m> to <m>y=-1</m>,
and our calculation of <m>\uvec{v}</m> above agrees.
</p>

<p>
The same vector with some other initial point will also have a terminal point that is <m>2</m> units to the right and <m>3</m> units down from the initial point.
In particular, if we take the initial point to be the origin,
then the terminal point will have coordinates <m>(2,-3)</m>,
same as the components of <m>\uvec{v}</m>.

<p> Notice that these different representations of the vector <m>\uvec{v}</m> are parallel and have the same length. </p>

<p>
Vectors can be similarly computed from pairs of points by subtracting coordinates in any dimension.
For example, we compute the vector that represents changing position in space from <m>P(1,2,-3)</m> to <m>Q(3,-1,0)</m> by
<md>
	<mrow> \uvec{v} \amp = (\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z) </mrow>
	<mrow> \amp = \bbrac{3-1, -1-2, 0-(-3)} </mrow>
	<mrow> \amp = (2,-3, 3) </mrow>
</md>.

<title>Vector operations</title>

<p>
Here we'll work through some of the computations of <xref ref="worksheet-vectors" />,
and provide the accompanying diagrams.
</p>

<example>
	<title>Vector addition in <m>\R^2</m></title>

	<p>
	In <xref ref="activity-vectors-geom-vec-add" />,
	we were tasked with geometrically adding vectors <m>\uvec{u} = (2,3)</m> and <m>\uvec{v} = (3,-1)</m> in the plane,
	starting at initial point <m>P(1,1)</m>.
	</p>

	<image width="70%">

		<description>Diagram of vector addition in the plane.</description>
		<latex-image><xi:include href="examples.d/vec-add.tex" parse="text" /></latex-image>
	</image>

	<p>
	To add vectors geometrically, we put them head-to-tail.
	The vector <m>\uvec{u} = (2,3)</m> instructs us to move <m>2</m> units right and <m>3</m> units up,
	so starting at <m>P(1,1)</m> we end up at <m>Q(3,4)</m>.
	Then the vector <m>\uvec{v} = (3,-1)</m> instructs us to move <m>3</m> units right and <m>1</m> unit down,
	so starting at <m>Q</m> we end up at <m>R(6,3)</m>.
	The sum vector <m>\uvec{u} + \uvec{v}</m> represents the <em>overall</em> change from <m>P</m> to <m>R</m>,
	which is <m>5</m> units right and <m>2</m> units up,
	so that <m>\uvec{u}+\uvec{v} = (5,2)</m>.
	We can also add the vectors algebraically by
	<md>
		<mrow> \uvec{u} + \uvec{v} \amp = (2,3) + (3,-1) </mrow>
		<mrow> \amp = \bbrac{2+3,3+(-1)} </mrow>
		<mrow> \amp = (5,2) </mrow>
	</md>.
	Adding the vectors algebraically is obviously faster and easier than drawing a diagram,
	but it's good to have a mental picture of the geometric version of addition <mdash />
	it will help conceptually later on.
	</p>

</example>

<example><title>Vector addition in higher dimensions</title><p>
	Our geometric picture and algebraic computation of addition are similar for three-dimensional vectors in space. In <m>\R^n</m> with <m>n>3</m>, we can't draw a picture but we could imagine vector addition would take same the familiar triangle shape, and the algebraic computations are similar again. For example,
	<md>
		<mrow> (1,2,3,4,5) + (6,-2,4,0,1) \amp = \bbrac{1+6,2+(-2),3+4,4+0,5+1} </mrow>
		<mrow> \amp = (7,0,7,4,6) </mrow>
	</md>
	in <m>\R^5</m>.
</p></example>

<example>
	<title>Negative vectors</title>

	<p>
	In <xref ref="activity-vectors-neg-vec" />,
	we explored the concept of a negative vector as the vector that will return us to our initial point,
	after changing positions along vector <m>\uvec{v} = (1,2)</m> in the plane,
	starting at the origin.
	Recall that if a vector has its initial point at the origin,
	then the terminal point has coordinates equal to the components of the vector.
	</p>

		<description> Diagram of a vector and its negative in the plane. </description>
		<latex-image><xi:include href="examples.d/vec-neg-1.tex" parse="text" /></latex-image>
	</image>

	<p>
	If <m>\uvec{v}</m> represents moving <m>1</m> unit right and <m>2</m> units up,
	then to return to our original position we must move <m>1</m> unit left and <m>2</m> units down,
	so that <m>-\uvec{v} = (-1,-2)</m>.
	Of course, the components of <m>-\uvec{v}</m> do not depend on what initial point we choose <mdash />
	we would need to make the same reverse change of position no matter where <m>\uvec{v}</m> started.
	</p>

	<p>
	As in <xref ref="subsection-vectors-concepts-vec-neg-vec-subtract"/>,
	it is helpful to have a mental picture of a negative vector where its initial point is the same as for the original vector.
	In this orientation, the vector and its negative are parallel but oppositely directed.
	</p>

<example>
	<title>Scalar multiplication</title>

	<p>
	In <xref ref="activity-vectors-scalar-mul" />,
	we explored scalar multiplication geometrically in the plane, using <m>\uvec{v} = (1,2)</m>,
	initially by relating scalar multiplication to addition.
	</p>

	<image width="35%">

		<description>Diagram of scalar multiplication of a vector in the plane.</description>
		<latex-image><xi:include href="examples.d/vec-scalar-mul.tex" parse="text" /></latex-image>
	</image>

	<p>
	The above diagram illustrates that <m>\uvec{v}+\uvec{v} = 2\uvec{v}</m>,
	which we can also confirm algebraically:
	<md>
		<mrow> \uvec{v}+\uvec{v} \amp = (1+1,2+2) </mrow>
		<mrow> \amp = (2,4) </mrow>
		<mrow> \amp = 2(1,2) </mrow>
		<mrow> \amp = 2\uvec{v} </mrow>
	</md>.
	Geometrically, the scalar multiples
	<m>3 \uvec{v}</m>, <m>-2 \uvec{v}</m>, <m>\frac{1}{2}\uvec{v}</m>, and <m>-\frac{5}{4} \uvec{v}</m>
	are all parallel to <m>\uvec{v}</m> but with lengths stretched or compressed by the scale factor.
	Additionally, a negative scalar multiple flips the vector around in the opposite direction.
	</p>

	<p>
	Since the initial point is the origin,
	each vector above has components equal to the coordinates of its terminal point.
	In particular, we have
	<md>
		<mrow>
			3\uvec{v} \amp= 3(1,2) = (3,6), \amp
			-2\uvec{v} \amp= -2(1,2) = (-2,-4),
		</mrow><mrow>
			\frac{1}{2}\uvec{v} \amp= \frac{1}{2}(1,2) = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right), \amp
			-\frac{5}{4}\uvec{v} \amp= -\frac{5}{4}(1,2) = \left(-\frac{5}{4},-\frac{5}{2}\right).
		</mrow>
	</md>
	In higher dimensions, scalar multiplication works in exactly the same way algebraically <mdash />
	we just multiply each component of the vector by the scale factor.
	For example, for <m>\uvec{v} = (1,-2,3,-4,5)</m> in <m>\R^5</m>,
	we have <me> -17\uvec{v} = (-17, 34, -51, 68, -85) </me>.
