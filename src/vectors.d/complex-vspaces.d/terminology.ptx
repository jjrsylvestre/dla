	<xref ref="definition-abstract-vec-spaces-concepts-abstract-vec-space" text="title" />
	(where we interpret <term>scalar</term> to mean <term>complex number</term> instead of just <term>real number</term>)

	</p>
	</li>

</dl></p>

<p>Here follows the notation we will use for some common complex vector space examples.</p>

<p><dl width="narrow">

	<li>
	<title><m>\C^n</m></title>
	<p>the collection of all <m>n</m>-dimensional complex vectors</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<title><m>\matrixring_{m \times n}(\C)</m></title>
	<p>
	the vector space of all <m>m\times n</m> matrices with entries that are complex numbers;
	as in the real case before,
	when <m>m=n</m> we sometimes just write <m>\matrixring_n(\C)</m> to mean the vector space of all square <m>n\times n</m> complex matrices
	</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<title><m>\poly(\C)</m></title>
	<p>	the vector space of all polynomials with complex coefficients in a single complex variable </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<title><m>\poly_n(\C)</m></title>
	<p> the vector space of all polynomials with complex coefficients in a single complex variable that have degree <m>n</m> or less </p>
	</li>

<!-- Why bother to include this, just extra "complexity" for very little "linear algebra" gain.
     See corresponding commented-out passages below and in concepts.ptx.
	<li>
	<title><m>F(D)</m></title>
	<p> the vector space of all complex-valued functions that are defined on the <em>complex</em> domain <m>D</m> </p>
	</li>
-->

</dl></p>

<!-- Only needed if F(D) is uncommented above.
<remark><p>
	You'll notice that the notation <m>F(D)</m> is the same for both the real vector space of real-valued functions and the complex vector space of complex-valued functions,
	with no inclusion of <m>\R</m> or <m>\C</m> in the notation to distinguish between the two.
	Which is meant should primarily be determined from whether the specified domain <m>D</m> is a set of real numbers or a set of complex numbers,
	but also the context of the surrounding discussion in which the notation appears should provide clues as to what is meant.
	From this point forward, we will try to be explicit about whether the real or complex case is meant.
</p></remark>

<p>
Finally, we will see in
<xref ref="subsection-complex-vspaces-concepts-complex-as-real-spaces" />
that every complex vector space can also be considered as a real vector space.
So in some of our notation we will occasionally need to make it clear which point of view is being used.
