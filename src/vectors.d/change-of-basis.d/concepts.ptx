<subsection xml:id="subsection-change-of-basis-concepts-coord-vecs-linearity">
<title>Linearity of coordinate vectors</title>

<p>
As a first step in our goal of exploring the concept of <term>transition matrix</term>,
we re-familiarized ourselves with <term>coordinate vectors</term>
and reminded ourselves of their <term>linearity properties</term>:
<md><mrow>
	\rmatrixOf{\uvec{v} + \uvec{w}}{B} \amp = \rmatrixOf{\uvec{v}}{B} + \rmatrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B} \text{,}
	\amp
	\rmatrixOf{k \uvec{v}}{B} \amp = k \rmatrixOf{\uvec{v}}{B} \text{.}
</mrow></md>
</p>
<aside><title>Also</title><p>
	These properties are of course true for coordinate vectors as column vectors,
	<m>\matrixOf{\uvec{v}}{B}</m> and <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B}</m>,
	as well.
</p></aside>

<p>
We first encountered these properties in
<xref ref="activity-basis-coords-linearity-of-coords" />
and
<xref ref="subsubsection-basis-coords-concepts-coords-linearity" />.
We will record these properties formally in
<xref ref="subsection-change-of-basis-theory-coord-linearity" />,
but for now what is most important for our development of the concept of
<term>transition matrix</term>
is the extension of these properties to linear combinations:
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-linearity-coordvecs" tag="star">
	\rmatrixOf{k_1 \uvec{v}_1 + k_2 \uvec{v}_2 + \dotsc + k_m \uvec{v}_m}{B}
	= k_1 \rmatrixOf{\uvec{v}_1}{B} + k_2 \rmatrixOf{\uvec{v}_2}{B} + \dotsc + k_m \rmatrixOf{\uvec{v}_m}{B}
</mrow></md>.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-change-of-basis-concepts-matrix-mul-lincomb">
<title><em>Matrix-times-vector</em> as a linear combination</title>

<p>
<xref ref="activity-change-of-basis-matrix-times-col" />
was a retread of
<xref ref="activity-col-row-null-space-colspan-motivation" />,
but from a different point of view.
In <xref ref="activity-col-row-null-space-colspan-motivation" />,
we discovered that a system <m>A \uvec{x} = \uvec{b}</m> is consistent if and only if the column vector <m>\uvec{b}</m> is somehow a linear combination of the columns of the coefficient matrix <m>A</m>.
But in <xref ref="activity-change-of-basis-matrix-times-col" />,
we focused on exactly <em>how</em> the product <m>A \uvec{x}</m> is a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m>.
</p>
<aside><title>Recall</title><p>
	Actually, we saw this pattern in passing already,
	in <xref ref="equation-col-row-null-space-concepts-lincomb-columns" />
	of <xref ref="subsection-col-row-null-space-concepts-colspace" />.
	<!-- TODO If the paragraphs in that subsection get turned into subsubsections, this second xref above could point to that subsubsection instead. -->
</p></aside>
<p>
Suppose <m>A</m> is an <m>m \times n</m> matrix,
considered as a collection of column vectors:
<me>
	A = \begin{bmatrix}
		| \amp | \amp \amp | \\
		\uvec{a}_1 \amp \uvec{a}_2 \amp \dots \amp \uvec{a}_n \\
		| \amp | \amp \amp | \\
	\end{bmatrix}
</me>.
We have seen a few times that a matrix times a standard basis vector is equal to the corresponding column of the matrix:
<me> A \uvec{e}_j = \uvec{a}_j </me>.
So if we expand the column vector
<me> \uvec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix} </me>
as a linear combination of standard basis vectors,
<me> \uvec{x} = x_1 \uvec{e}_1 + x_2 \uvec{e}_2 + \dotsb + x_n \uvec{e}_n </me>,
then we can compute <m>A\uvec{x}</m> by multiplying <m>A</m> through this linear combination:
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-matrix-times-vec-pattern" tag="dstar">
	\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
		A \uvec{x} \amp = \amp x_1 A \uvec{e}_1 \amp + \amp x_2 A \uvec{e}_2 \amp + \amp \dotsb \amp + \amp x_n A \uvec{e}_n \\
		 \amp = \amp x_1 \uvec{a}_1 \amp + \amp x_2 \uvec{a}_2 \amp + \amp \dotsb \amp + \amp x_n \uvec{a}_n
	\end{array}
</mrow></md>.
From this, we see that
<alert>a matrix times a vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the columns of the matrix with coefficients taken from the vector</alert>.
</p>

</subsection>


<subsection xml:id="subsection-change-of-basis-concepts-coord-vecs-convert">
<title>Converting coordinate vectors</title>

<p>
In <xref ref="activity-change-of-basis-cob-matrix" />,
we explored how we might convert from coordinate vectors relative to one basis to those relative to another basis.
</p><p>
Suppose we have a basis <m>\basisfont{B}</m> for some particular finite-dimensional vector space <m>V</m>.
Every vector <m>\uvec{w}</m> in <m>V</m> can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-lincomb" tag="tstar">
	\uvec{w} = k_1 \uvec{u}_1 + k_2 \uvec{u}_2 + \dotsc + k_n \uvec{u}_n,
</mrow></md>
where the <m>\uvec{u}_j</m> are the basis vectors in <m>\basisfont{B}</m>
(<xref ref="theorem-basis-coords-basis-lin-comb-is-unique" />),
and the <m>n</m>-dimensional vector
<me> \rmatrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B} = (k_1,k_2,\dotsc,k_n) </me>
made up of the coefficients in that linear combination are precisely what we call the <term>coordinate vector</term> of <m>\uvec{w}</m> relative to basis <m>\basisfont{B}</m>.
Now, what if we have a second basis <m>\basisfont{B}'</m> for <m>V</m>?
We may have already gone to the work of computing the coordinate vectors for a number of vectors in <m>V</m> relative to <m>\basisfont{B}</m>.
Can we easily convert these coordinate vectors to new ones relative to <m>\basisfont{B}'</m>?
</p><p>
To see how this can be done with a matrix,
let's switch to coordinate vectors as column vectors.
Just as in
<xref ref="activity-change-of-basis-cob-matrix-lin-comb" />,
we can use linearity property
<xref ref="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-linearity-coordvecs" />
applied to
<xref ref="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-lincomb" />
to obtain an expression for the new coordinate vector <m>\matrixOf{w}{B'}</m>
as a linear combination in <m>\R^n</m> of coordinate vectors:
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-second-basis-coordvec-lincomb" tag="dagger">
	\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B'}
	= k_1 \matrixOf{\uvec{u}_1}{B'}
	+ k_2  \matrixOf{\uvec{u}_2}{B'}
	+ \dotsc
	+ k_n \matrixOf{\uvec{u}_n}{B'}.
</mrow></md>
</p><p>
Now, the pattern of
<xref ref="activity-change-of-basis-matrix-times-col-pattern" />
tells us that for every matrix <m>P</m> of appropriate size to multiply against the column vector <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B}</m>,
the product <m> P \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B} </m> can be expressed as
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-matrix-times-col-pattern" tag="ddagger">
	P \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B}
	= P \begin{bmatrix} k_1 \\ k_2 \\ \vdots \\ k_n \end{bmatrix}
	= k_1 \uvec{p}_1 + k_2 \uvec{p}_2 + \dotsb + k_n \uvec{p}_n,
</mrow></md>
where the <m>\uvec{p}_j</m> are the columns of <m>P</m>.
Combining
<xref ref="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-second-basis-coordvec-lincomb" />
with
<xref ref="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-matrix-times-col-pattern" />
gives us a way to use matrix multiplication to convert coordinate vector
<m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B}</m> into <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B'}</m>:
if we take <m>P</m> to be the matrix whose columns are the coordinate vectors relative to <m>\basisfont{B}'</m> of the basis vectors of <m>\basisfont{B}</m>,
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-transition-matrix-def" tag="tdagger">
	P = \begin{bmatrix}
		| \amp | \amp \amp | \\
		\matrixOf{\uvec{u}_1}{B'} \amp \matrixOf{\uvec{u}_2}{B'} \amp \dots \amp \matrixOf{\uvec{u}_n}{B'} \\
		| \amp | \amp \amp |
	\end{bmatrix}
</mrow></md>,
then
<me>
	P \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B}
	= k_1 \matrixOf{\uvec{u}_1}{B'} + k_2 \matrixOf{\uvec{u}_2}{B'} + \dotsb + k_n \matrixOf{\uvec{u}_n}{B'}
	= \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B'}
</me>.
We call the special matrix <m>P</m> defined in
<xref ref="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-transition-matrix-def" />
the <term>transition matrix</term> from basis <m>\basisfont{B}</m> to basis <m>\basisfont{B}'</m>,
and write <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{B'}</m> to denote it.
</p><p>
As usual, it is helpful to express the pattern of
<xref ref="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-transition-matrix-def" /> in words,
and you were asked to do this in
<xref ref="activity-change-of-basis-cobmatrix-pattern" />.
If we refer to <m>\basisfont{B}</m> as the <q>old basis</q> and <m>\basisfont{B}'</m> as the <q>new basis</q>,
then the transition matrix <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{B'}</m> is formed as
<alert>the <m>n \times n</m> matrix whose columns are the coordinate vectors of the old basis relative to the new basis</alert>.
</p>

<algorithm xml:id="procedure-change-of-basis-concepts-cob-by-pattern"> <!-- algorithm is hijacked to "Procedure" -->
	<title>Computing a transition matrix</title>
	<statement><p>
		To compute a transition matrix <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{B'}</m>,
		where <m>\basisfont{B}</m> and <m>\basisfont{B}'</m> are bases of the same <m>n</m>-dimensional space,
		first calculate the coordinate vector of each vector in <m>\basisfont{B}</m> relative to the basis <m>\basisfont{B}'</m>.
		Then use these coordinate vectors, in order, as columns in the <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{B'}</m>.
	</p></statement>
</algorithm>

<p>
We worked through an example of forming and using a transition matrix in
<xref ref="activity-change-of-basis-cobmatrix-example" />,
and you can also look through
<xref ref="example-change-of-basis-compute-cob" />
in
<xref ref="subsection-change-of-basis-examples-computing" />,
which is similar.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-change-of-basis-concepts-properties">
<title>Properities of transition matrices</title>

<p>
In <xref ref="activity-change-of-basis-properties" />,
we explored properties of transition matrices via the defining property
<me> \ucobmtrx{B}{B'} \matrixOf{\uvec{v}}{B} = \matrixOf{\uvec{v}}{B'} </me>.
We will state and prove each of the discovered properties in
<xref ref="subsection-change-of-basis-theory-cob-props" />,
but we briefly recount them here.
</p>

<paragraphs><title>No change of basis</title><p>
First, we considered the transition matrix for the case where the <q>new</q> basis is the same as the <q>old</q>.
In this case,
we want to <q>convert</q> each coordinate vector <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B}</m> to the coordinate vector <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B'}</m>.
That is, we want the conversion to have no effect at all.
We already know a matrix that has no effect when it is multiplied against other matrices:
the identity matrix.
So we expect
<me> \ucobmtrx{B}{B} = I. </me>
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Chains of basis changes</title><p>
Next, we considered the transition matrices
<m> \ucobmtrx{B}{B'} </m>, <m>\ucobmtrx{B'}{B''}</m>, and <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{B''}</m>
associated to three bases of a particular vector space.
We could consider the transition from the first basis <m>\basisfont{B}</m> to the third basis <m>\basisfont{B}''</m> as a two-step process,
first converting <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B}</m> to <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B'}</m> by
<me> \ucobmtrx{B}{B'} \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B} = \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B'} </me>,
and then converting <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B'}</m> to <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B''}</m> by
<me> \ucobmtrx{B'}{B''} \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B'} = \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B''} </me>.
Substituting the first expression for <m>\matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B'}</m> into the second equality, we find
<me> \ucobmtrx{B'}{B''} \ucobmtrx{B}{B'} \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B} = \matrixOf{\uvec{w}}{B''} </me>,
and so we expect
<me> \ucobmtrx{B'}{B''} \ucobmtrx{B}{B'} = \ucobmtrx{B}{B''} </me>.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Reversing change of basis</title><p>
Finally, we considered the relationship between transition matrices
<m> \ucobmtrx{B}{B'} </m> and <m>\ucobmtrx{B'}{B}</m>.
Transitioning <m>\basisfont{B}' \to \basisfont{B}</m> should be the reverse process of transitioning <m>\basisfont{B} \to \basisfont{B}'</m>,
and so we expect
<me> \ucobmtrx{B'}{B} = \uinvcobmtrx{B}{B'} </me>.
This relationship agrees with our expectations for no change of basis and chains of basis changes above,
since if we consider basis <m>\basisfont{B}</m> to be both the first and third basis in a chain of basis changes,
then
<me> \ucobmtrx{B'}{B} \ucobmtrx{B}{B'} = \ucobmtrx{B}{B} = I </me>
as expected if matrices <m> \ucobmtrx{B}{B'} </m> and <m>\ucobmtrx{B'}{B}</m> are inverses.
</p></paragraphs>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-change-of-basis-concepts-in-Rn">
<title>Change of basis in <m>\R^n</m></title>

<subsubsection xml:id="subsection-change-of-basis-concepts-in-Rn-to-std">
<title>Changing to the standard basis</title>

<p>
In <xref ref="activity-change-of-basis-Rn" />,
we first reminded ourselves that, relative to the standard basis <m>\basisfont{S}</m> of <m>\R^n</m>,
a vector is equal to its coordinate vector.
In particular,
if <m>\basisfont{B}</m> is another basis of <m>\R^n</m>,
then each basis vector in <m>\basisfont{B}</m> is equal to its own coordinate vector <em>relative to the standard basis</em>.
So when we form a transition matrix <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{S}</m>,
the columns of this matrix are precisely the vectors of basis <m>\basisfont{B}</m>,
which makes <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{S}</m> particularly easy to produce.
</p>

</subsubsection>


<subsubsection xml:id="subsection-change-of-basis-concepts-in-Rn-std-in-middle">
<title>Computing transition matrices using the standard basis as an intermediate</title>

<p>
Since transition matrices with the standard basis as the <q>new</q> basis are easy to produce,
we can use the standard basis as an intermediate in a chain of basis changes to obtain any transition matrix <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{B'}</m> for bases of <m>\R^n</m>.
Using what we learned in
<xref ref="subsection-change-of-basis-concepts-properties" />,
we can write
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-inv-prod-formula-Rn" tag="maltese">
	\ucobmtrx{B}{B'}
	= \ucobmtrx{S}{B'} \ucobmtrx{B}{S}
	= \uinvcobmtrx{B'}{S} \ucobmtrx{B}{S}
</mrow></md>,
and so we can compute <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{B'}</m> from the easy-to-produce transition matrices <m>\ucobmtrx{B}{S}</m> and <m>\ucobmtrx{B'}{S}</m>.
</p>

</subsubsection>

<subsubsection xml:id="subsection-change-of-basis-concepts-in-Rn-by-row-red">
<title>Computing transition matrices using row reduction</title>

<p>
We use row reduction to do just about everything,
so of course we can use it to compute transition matrices!
Now, computing a transition matrix using
<xref ref="procedure-change-of-basis-concepts-cob-by-pattern" />
would already be carried out by (a lot) of row reducing,
as computing a coordinate vector is equivalent to solving a linear system.
(See the coordinate vector examples in <xref ref="subsection-basis-coords-examples-coord-vecs" />.)
But from <xref ref="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-inv-prod-formula-Rn" />,
we can use what we learned about computing inverses in
<xref ref="subsection-elem-matrices-concepts-invert-by-row-red" />
to develop a procedure for computing a transition matrix for <m>\R^n</m> by row reducing a single matrix.
</p><p>
In <xref ref="subsection-elem-matrices-concepts-invert-by-row-red" />,
we learned that if a matrix can be reduced to the identity by some sequence of row operations,
then the exact same sequence of row operations will <q>unreduce</q> the identity matrix to the inverse of the original matrix.
Look back at
<xref ref="equation-elem-matrices-concepts-inversion-by-row-red-pattern" />
in <xref ref="subsection-elem-matrices-concepts-invert-by-row-red" />,
which describes the pattern of
<xref ref="procedure-elem-matrices-concepts-inversion-by-row-red" />.
Here is that pattern again, but in abbreviated form:
<me>
	\left[\begin{array}{c|c} A \amp I \end{array}\right] \qquad \rowredarrow \qquad
	\left[\begin{array}{c|c} E_{\ell} \dotsm E_2 E_1 A \amp E_{\ell} \dotsm E_2 E_1 I \end{array}\right]
	= \left[\begin{array}{c|c} I \amp \inv{A} \end{array}\right]
</me>,
where the <m>E_j</m> are the elementary matrices associated to a sequence of operations that reduces <m>A</m> to <m>I</m>.
</p>

<p>
What if we augmented <m>A</m> with a matrix other than <m>I</m> and row reduced?
Then the pattern would be
<md>
	<mrow> \amp \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A \amp B \end{array}\right] </mrow>
	<mrow xml:id="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-row-red-aug-transfer-inv" tag="dmaltese">
		\amp \qquad \rowredarrow \qquad
		\left[\begin{array}{c|c} E_{\ell} \dotsm E_2 E_1 A \amp E_{\ell} \dotsm E_2 E_1 B \end{array}\right]
		= \left[\begin{array}{c|c} I \amp \inv{A} B \end{array}\right]
	</mrow>
</md>.
This pattern reveals that we can also carry out an inverse-times-matrix computation by row reducing!
And that kind of computation is exactly what we would carry out if we used
<xref ref="equation-change-of-basis-concepts-inv-prod-formula-Rn" />
to compute a transition matrix for <m>\R^n</m>.
