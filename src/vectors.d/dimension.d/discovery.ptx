		We've been using the word <q>dimension</q> informally throughout our developlment of the concepts of vectors
		(<eg /> calling vectors in <m>\R^2</m> <em>two-dimensional</em> vectors),
		but finally we can match our intuition about the <q>dimension</q> of the various types of subspaces of <m>\R^3</m> with the theoretical concepts of <term>linear independence</term> and <term>spanning</term> to make the following definition.

<activity xml:id="activity-dimension-basis-via-parameters">

	<prelude>
		<p>
		One way to obtain a basis for a space
		(and hence to determine its dimension)
		is to <em>assign parameters</em> <mdash />
		then each <em>independent</em> parameter corresponds to a basis vector.
		</p><p>
		For example,
		in <m>\R^2</m> we have natural parameters associated to the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-coordinates:
		<m>\uvec{x} = (x,y)</m>.
		Expanding this into a linear combination,
		we get <m>\uvec{x} = x(1,0) + y(0,1)</m>.
		Parameter <m>x</m> corresponds to vector <m>(1,0)</m> and parameter <m>y</m> corresponds to vector <m>(0,1)</m>,
		and together the two corresponding vectors form a basis <m>\{(1,0),(0,1)\}</m> for <m>\R^2</m>.
		(In fact, the <term>standard basis</term> for <m>\R^2</m>!).
		Since there were <em>two</em> independent parameters required to described an arbitrary vector in the space,
		this led to <em>two</em> basis vectors,
		and so the dimension of <m>\R^2</m> is (surprise!) <m>2</m>.
		</p>
		<paragraphs><title>Step-by-step procedure</title><p><ol>
			<li> Express arbitrary elements in the space in terms of parameters. </li>
			<li>
				Use any extra conditions to reduce to the minimum number of <em>independent</em> parameters
				(if necessary).
			</li>
			<li> Split up your parametric vector description into a linear combination based on the remaining parameters. </li>
			<li> Extract the basis vector attached to each parameter. </li>
			<li>
				Count the basis vectors to determine the dimension of the space
				(which should also correspond to the number of independent parameters required).

		A vector space is called <term>finite-dimensional</term> if it can be spanned by a finite set;
		otherwise, it is called <term>infinite-dimensional</term>.
		For example,
		<m>\R^n</m> is finite-dimensional for each value of <m>n</m>,
		because it can be spanned by the finite set of standard basis vectors
		<m>\{\uvec{e}_1,\uvec{e}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{e}_n\}</m>.

<activity xml:id="activity-dimension-enlarge-indep">
	<prelude><p>
		We've already seen that a linearly dependent spanning set can be reduced to a basis
		(<xref ref="proposition-basis-coords-reduce-span-to-basis" />).
		Working the other way,
		we will use
		<xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-expand-indep" />
		to argue in
		<xref ref="subsection-dimension-theory-linear-indep-consequences" />
		that a linearly independent set that is not a spanning set can be <em>built up</em> to a basis by including additional vectors
		(<xref ref="proposition-dimension-increase-indep-to-basis" />).
		<xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-expand-indep" /> tells us exactly how to do this:
		to ensure linear independence at each step,
		the new vector to be included should not be in the span of the old
		(<ie /> the new should not be any linear combination of the old).

	<introduction>
		<p>
		In each of the following,
		enlarge the provided linearly independent set into a basis for the space.

		<paragraphs><title>Hint</title><p>
			Since we now know the dimensions of these spaces,
			we know how many linearly independent vectors are required to form a basis.
			Just guess <em>simple</em> new vectors to include in the given set,
			one at a time,
			and for each make sure your new vector is not a linear combination of the vectors you already have.
			(You can check this by trying to solve an appropriate system of linear equations.)
