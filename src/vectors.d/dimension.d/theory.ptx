<title>Dimension as size of a basis</title>

<p>
Since <term>dimension</term> is defined in terms of <term>basis</term>,
it is important to know that we can always find a basis.
The following fact is true for all vector spaces,
but we will state and prove it only for finite-dimensional spaces.
It is essentially just a restatement of
<xref ref="proposition-basis-coords-reduce-span-to-basis" />
(which itself is a restatement of
<xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-reduce-span-to-indep" />).
</p>

<theorem>
	<statement><p> Every finite-dimensional vector space has a basis. </p></statement>
	<proof><p>
		By definition,
		a vector space is finite-dimensional when it has a finite spanning set.
		<xref ref="proposition-basis-coords-reduce-span-to-basis" />
		states that every finite spanning set can be reduced to a basis.
		So if a finite spanning set exists for a space,
		so does a basis.
	</p></proof>
</theorem>

<p>The next two facts allow us to attach a <em>single</em> number to a vector space as <em>the</em> dimension of the space.</p>

<lemma xml:id="lemma-dimension-basis-finite-dim-is-finite">
	<statement><p>
		A basis for a finite-dimensional vector space must contain a finite number of vectors.
	</p></statement>
	<proof><p>
		By definition,
		a finite-dimensional vector space has at least one example of a spanning set that contains a finite number of vectors.
		By <xref ref="lemma-linear-indep-more-than-spanning-is-dep" />,
		any other set of vectors from this space that contains <em>more</em> vectors than this example spanning set must be linearly dependent.
		But a basis is always linearly independent,
		and so cannot have more vectors than the finite number in this example spanning set.
	</p></proof>
</lemma>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-dimension-every-basis-same-number">
	<title>Uniformity of dimension</title>
	<statement><p> Every basis for a finite-dimensional vector space has the same number of vectors. </p></statement>
	<proof>
		<p>
		Suppose <m>\basisfont{B}_1</m> and <m>\basisfont{B}_2</m> are two different bases for a finite-dimensional vector space <m>V</m>.
		First, both <m>\basisfont{B}_1</m> and <m>\basisfont{B}_2</m> must contain a finite number of vectors,
		by <xref ref="lemma-dimension-basis-finite-dim-is-finite" />.
		Now, <m>\basisfont{B}_1</m> is a basis,
		so it is a spanning set,
		and so by
		<xref ref="lemma-linear-indep-more-than-spanning-is-dep" />
		any set that contains more vectors than <m>\basisfont{B}_1</m> must be linearly dependent.
		But <m>\basisfont{B}_2</m> is also a basis,
		so it is linearly independent.
		Therefore, <m>\basisfont{B}_2</m> cannot contain <em>more</em> vectors than there are in <m>\basisfont{B}_1</m>.
		</p><p>
		The same reasoning works the other way:
		<m>\basisfont{B}_1</m> cannot contain <em>more</em> vectors than there are in the spanning set <m>\basisfont{B}_2</m>,
		otherwise it would be linearly dependent.
		Since neither set of vectors can contain more vectors than the other,
		the two sets must contain <em>exactly the same</em> number of vectors.

<title>Consequences for the theory of linear dependence/independence and spanning</title>

<p>
Now we extend
<xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-expand-indep" />
to establish a <q>building-up</q> counterpart to
<xref ref="proposition-basis-coords-reduce-span-to-basis" />.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-dimension-increase-indep-to-basis">
	<title>Enlarging an independent set to a basis</title>
	<statement><p>
		In a finite-dimensional vector space,
		every linearly independent set of vectors can be enlarged to a basis.
		That is, if <m>S</m> is a linearly independent set of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space,
		then there exists a basis for the space that contains <m>S</m> as a subcollection.
	</p></statement>
	<aside><title>Clarification</title><p>
		In this proposition,
		we consider the hypothetical <q>can be enlarged</q> to allow the possibility of not enlarging the set at all,
		in case the linearly independent set is already a basis.
	</p></aside>
	<proof><p>
		Suppose <m>S</m> is a linearly independent set of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space.
		If it is also a spanning set,
		then it is already a basis and does not need to be enlarged.
		If it is not a spanning set,
		then there are vectors in the space that are not in <m>\Span S</m>.
		Choose a vector <m>\uvec{v}</m> <em>not</em> in <m>\Span S</m>,
		and let <m>S'</m> be the set that contains all the vectors of <m>S</m> as well as <m>\uvec{v}</m>.
		By
		<xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-expand-indep" />,
		the set <m>S'</m> is still linearly independent.
		If <m>S'</m> is also a spanning set,
		then it is a basis and we have the desired enlargement from <m>S</m>.
		Otherwise, we could again enlarge <m>S'</m> by some vector that is <em>not</em> in <m>\Span S'</m> and still have a linearly independent set.
		We can continue in this fashion,
		but we will have to reach a point where we will not be able to enlarge our set any further without it becoming linearly dependent,
		since we know that in a finite-dimensional space,
		once a set of vectors gets too large it can no longer be linearly independent
		(<xref ref="lemma-linear-indep-more-than-spanning-is-dep" />).
		At this point,
		our enlarged linearly independent set <em>must</em> also be a spanning set (and hence a basis),
		since if it weren't we <em>would</em> be able to enlarge it again as before,
		with the enlarged set remaining independent.
	</p></proof>
</proposition>

<p>
The concept of dimension gives us another way to know whether a set of vectors is a basis,
since it is the <q>just-right</q> size for a set of vectors to be a basis.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-dimension-right-num-indep-iff-spanning">
	<title>Using dimension to help test basis</title>
	<statement><p>
		Suppose <m>S</m> is a set of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space,

	</ol></p></proof>
</proposition>

<corollary xml:id="corollary-dimension-basis-right-num-just-one-check">
	<statement><p>
		Suppose <m>S</m> is a set of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space,
		and the number of vectors in <m>S</m> is exactly equal to the dimension of the vector space.
		If <m>S</m> is <em>either</em> known to be linearly independent <em>or</em> known to be a spanning set,

	</p></statement>
</corollary>

<remark><p>
	In a space whose dimension is known,
	the above corollary effectively reduces the amount of work required to check whether a set of vectors is a basis in half,
	since if we start with the right number of vectors in a basis-candidate set then we only need to check one of the requirements in the definition of <term>basis</term>.
	In practice,
	it is usually easier to carry out
	the <xref ref="procedure-linear-indep-concepts-test-for-dep-indep" text="title"/>
	than it is to check for spanning.

<subsection xml:id="subsection-dimension-theory-subspace">
<title>Dimension of subspaces</title>

<p>
As discussed in
<xref ref="subsection-dimension-concepts-subspace" />,
a set of linearly independent vectors in a subspace is still linearly independent when considered as a set of vectors in the larger space.
So we can use
<xref ref="proposition-dimension-increase-indep-to-basis" />
to relate a basis for a subspace to a basis for the whole space,
and then also the dimension of the subspace to the dimension of the whole space.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-dimension-subspace-dim-props">
	<statement><p>
		Suppose <m>U</m> is a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space <m>V</m>.
		Then the following all hold true.
		<ol>
			<li xml:id="proposition-dimension-subspace-dim-props-enlarge">
				Every basis for <m>U</m> can be enlarged to a basis for <m>V</m>.
			</li>
			<li xml:id="proposition-dimension-subspace-dim-props-le">
				We have <m>\dim U \le \dim V</m>.

			<li xml:id="proposition-dimension-subspace-dim-props-same-dim">
				It is the case that <m>\dim U = \dim V</m> only if <m>U</m> is actually the whole space <m>V</m>.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p></statement>
	<proof><p><ol>
		<li>
			Since <m>U</m> is a subspace of <m>V</m>,
			each vector of <m>U</m> is also a vector of <m>V</m>.
			So a basis for <m>U</m> will be a linearly independent set of vectors in <m>V</m>,
			which
			<xref ref="proposition-dimension-increase-indep-to-basis" />
			tells us can be enlarged to a basis for <m>V</m>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Recall that the dimenion of a vector space
			(whether a subspace of another space or not)
			is defined to be the number of vectors in a basis for the space.
			Since every basis for <m>U</m> can be enlarged to a basis for <m>V</m>,
			the number of vectors in a basis for <m>U</m> cannot be larger than the number of vectors in a basis for <m>V</m>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Let <m>\basisfont{B}</m> be a basis for <m>U</m>,
			so that <m>U = \Span\basisfont{B}</m>.
			If we have <m>\dim U = \dim V</m>,
			then the number of vectors in <m>\basisfont{B}</m> is exactly equal to the dimension of <m>V</m>.
			But <m>\basisfont{B}</m> is also linearly independent in <m>V</m>,
			so by
			<xref ref="proposition-dimension-right-num-indep-iff-spanning-indep-imp-spanning">Statement</xref>
			of
			<xref ref="proposition-dimension-right-num-indep-iff-spanning" />,
			it must also be a spanning set for <m>V</m>.
			Thus,
			<m>U = \Span\basisfont{B} = V</m>.
