		<p>
		<xref ref="activity-linear-indep-motivation" /> demonstrates a common pattern:
		when one of the vectors in a spanning set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others, that vector becomes <em>redundant</em>,
		and a smaller spanning set can be used in place of the original one.
		We'll give this situation a name:
		a set of vectors is called
		<term>linearly dependent</term><idx><h>linearly</h><h>dependent</h></idx>
		if (at least) one of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of other vectors in the set;
		otherwise the set of vectors is called
		<term>linearly independent</term><idx><h>linearly</h><h>independent</h></idx>.
		However, it can be tedious to check each vector in a set one-by-one to see if it is a linear combination of others.
		Luckily, for a finite set of vectors, there is a way to check all of them all at once.

	<prelude><p>
		The next discovery activity will help you understand the Test for Linear Independence/Dependence.
		To keep it simple, we'll consider just three vectors at a time.

	<task>

		<p>
		Consider abstract vectors <m>\uvec{u}_1,\uvec{u}_2,\uvec{u}_3</m>, and suppose the vector equation
		<md><mrow tag="dstar" xml:id="activity-linear-indep-understand-test-equation1">
			k_1\uvec{u}_1 + k_2\uvec{u}_2 + k_3\uvec{u}_3 = \zerovec
		</mrow></md>
		has a nontrivial solution.
		This means that there are values for the scalars <m>k_1,k_2,k_3</m>, at least one of which is not zero,
		so that equation <xref ref="activity-linear-indep-understand-test-equation1" /> is true.
		</p>

		<p>
		Use some algebra to manipulate equation <xref ref="activity-linear-indep-understand-test-equation1" />
		to demonstrate that one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others
		(and hence, <em>by definition</em>, the vectors <m>\uvec{u}_1,\uvec{u}_2,\uvec{u}_3</m> are linearly dependent).

		<aside><title>Careful</title><p> Make sure you don't accidentally divide by zero! </p></aside>

		<p>
		Consider abstract vectors <m>\uvec{w}_1,\uvec{w}_2,\uvec{w}_3</m>, and suppose the vector equation
		<md><mrow tag="tstar" xml:id="activity-linear-indep-understand-test-equation2">
			k_1\uvec{w}_1 + k_2\uvec{w}_2 + k_3\uvec{w}_3 = \zerovec

		has <em>only</em> the trivial solution.
		We would like to see why this means that <m>\uvec{w}_1,\uvec{w}_2,\uvec{w}_3</m> are linearly independent.
		</p>

		<p>
		Suppose they weren't:
		for example, suppose <m>\uvec{w}_3 = c_1\uvec{w}_1 + c_2\uvec{w}_2</m> were true for some scalars <m>c_1,c_2</m>.
		Manipulate this expression for <m>\uvec{w}_3</m> until is says something about equation
		<xref ref="activity-linear-indep-understand-test-equation2" />.
		Do you see now why <m>\uvec{w}_1,\uvec{w}_2,\uvec{w}_3</m> <em>cannot</em> satisfy the <em>definition</em> of linearly dependence,
		and hence must be linearly independent?
