	As in <xref ref="activity-orthog-guess-orthog-in-plane" />, and as discussed in
	<xref ref="subsection-orthog-concepts-orthog" />, it's fairly easy to form orthogonal vectors in <m>\R^2</m>.
	And it's not that much more difficult in <m>\R^3</m>.
	<ol>
		<li>
			The vectors <m>\uvec{u} = (3,7)</m> and <m>\uvec{v} = (-7,3)</m> are orthogonal in <m>\R^2</m>, because
			<me> \udotprod{u}{v} = 3\cdot (-7) + 7\cdot 3 = -21 + 21 = 0 </me>.
		</li>
		<li>
			The vectors <m>\uvec{u} = (3,7,1)</m> and <m>\uvec{v} = (-7,2,7)</m> are orthogonal in <m>\R^3</m>, because
			<me> \udotprod{u}{v} = 3\cdot (-7) + 7\cdot 2 + 1\cdot 7 = -21 + 14 + 7 = 0 </me>.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p></example>

<example><title>Orthogonality of the standard basis vectors</title>
	<p>
	In <m>\R^n</m>, the standard basis vectors are always orthogonal to each other.
	When we compute <m>\dotprod{\uvec{e}_i}{\uvec{e}_j}</m> with <m>i\neq j</m>, the <m>1</m> in the <m>\nth[i]</m> component of <m>\uvec{e}_i</m> won't line up with the <m>1</m> in the <m>\nth[j]</m> component of <m>\uvec{e}_j</m>,
	and we'll get a computation something like
	<md>
		<mrow>
		\dotprod{\uvec{e}_i}{\uvec{e}_j}
		\amp
		= 0\cdot 0 + \dotsb + 0\cdot 0
		+ \overbrace{1\cdot 0}^{\nth[i]\text{ times }\nth[i]}
		+ 0 \cdot 0 + \dotsb + 0\cdot 0
		+ \overbrace{0\cdot 1}^{\nth[j]\text{ times }\nth[j]}
		+ 0 \cdot 0 + \dotsb + 0\cdot 0

<title>Orthogonal projection</title>

<p> Let's complete the computations from <xref ref="activity-orthog-proj" />. </p>

<example>
	<title>Using orthogonal projection to compute distance from a point to a line in <m>\R^2</m></title>

	<p>
	The line through the origin and parallel to <m>\uvec{a} = (3,1)</m> consists of all scalar multiples of <m>\uvec{a}</m>.
	We would like to know the following.
	<ul>
		<li> What is the point on this line closest to the point <m>Q(4,4)</m>? </li>
		<li> What is the distance from <m>Q</m> to the line? </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	We know that the point we are looking for is at the terminal point of <m>\proj_{\uvec{a}} \uvec{u}</m>, where <m>\uvec{u} = \abray{OQ} = (4,4)</m>.
	So compute
	<me>
		\proj_{\uvec{a}} \uvec{u}
		= \frac{4\cdot 3 + 4\cdot 1}{3^2 + 1^2}\; (3,1)
		= \frac{8}{5} (3,1)
		= \left(\frac{24}{5}, \frac{8}{5}\right)
	</me>,
	which tells us that the point on the line closest to <m>Q</m> is <m>P(24/5,8/5)</m>.
	Now, the vector
	<me> \uvec{n} = \abray{PQ} = (-4/5,12/5) </me>
	will be a normal vector for the line, extending from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>,
	and so the norm of this vector represents the (perpendicular) distance between <m>Q</m> and the line:
	<me>
		d
		= \unorm{n}
		= \sqrt{\left(-\frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{12}{5}\right)^2}
		= \sqrt{\frac{160}{25}}
		= \frac{4\sqrt{10}}{5}
	</me>.

<subsection xml:id="subsection-orthog-examples-cross-product">
<title>Cross product</title>

<p> Here is an example of using the cross product to answer a geometry question in <m>\R^3</m>. </p>

<example xml:id="example-orthog-cross-product">
	<title>Using cross product to determine the equation of a plane in <m>\R^3</m></title>

	<p>
	Suppose we would like to determine the equation of the plane in <m>\R^3</m> that passes through the point <m>(3,3,3)</m> and is parallel to the vectors <m>\uvec{u} = (1,2,-3)</m> and <m>\uvec{v} = (0,2,5)</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	The equation we are looking for is of the form <m>a x + b y + c z = d</m>.
	We know that <m>a,b,c</m> can be taken to be the components of any normal vector for the plane.
	A normal vector for the plane must be orthogonal to the plane, and hence must be orthogonal to each of <m>\uvec{u}</m> and <m>\uvec{v}</m>.
	We can use the cross product to compute such a vector:
	<md>
		<mrow>
			\uvec{n}
			= \ucrossprod{u}{v}
			\amp
			= \left\lvert\begin{array}{rrr}
				\ivec{} \amp \jvec{} \amp \kvec{} \\
				1 \amp 2 \amp -3 \\
				0 \amp 2 \amp 5
			\end{array}\right\rvert
		</mrow><mrow>
			\amp
			= \ivec{}\bbrac{2\cdot 5 - (-3)\cdot 2}
			- \jvec{}\bbrac{1\cdot 5 - (-3)\cdot 0}
			+ \kvec{}(1\cdot 2 - 2\cdot 0)
		</mrow>
		<mrow> \amp = \injkvec{16}{5}{2} </mrow>
	</md>.
	So we can use <m>16 x - 5 y + 2 z = d</m> as the equation of the plane, for some as-yet-to-be-determined value of <m>d</m>.
	But we also know that the plane passes through the point <m>(3,3,3)</m>,
	so we must have
	<me> 16 \cdot 3 - 5 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3 = d \qquad\implies\qquad d = 39 </me>.
	Thus, the plane can be described algebraically by the equation <m>16 x - 5 y + 2 z = 39</m>,
	or in point-normal form by the equation
	<m>\dotprod{\uvec{n}}{(\uvec{x}-\uvec{x}_0)} = 0</m>,
	where <m>\uvec{n}</m> is as computed above, <m>\uvec{x}_0</m> is the
	<q>base</q> point <m>(3,3,3)</m>, and <m>\uvec{x} = (x,y,z)</m> is a variable point.
