<title>Discovery guide</title>

<introduction>
	<p>
	If <m>P</m> is a square matrix,
	write <m>\uvec{p}_1, \uvec{p}_2, \dotsc, \uvec{p}_n</m> for the columns of <m>P</m>,
	so that
	<m> P = \begin{bmatrix} \uvec{p}_1 \amp \uvec{p}_2 \amp \cdots \amp \uvec{p}_n \end{bmatrix} </m>.
	</p><p>
	For this discovery guide,
	we will need to recall a few important things.
	<ul>
		<li>
			An <m>n \times n</m> matrix is invertible if and only if its columns form a basis of <m>\R^n</m>
			(<xref ref="theorem-col-row-null-space-equiv-to-invertible" />).
		</li>
		<li>
			Similarity relation <m>\inv{P} A P = B</m> holds if and only if each column of <m>B</m> consists of coefficients for expressing the corresponding transformed vector <m>A \uvec{p}_j</m> as a linear combination of the columns of <m>P</m>
			(<xref ref="subsection-similarity-concepts-algebra" />).
		</li>
		<li>
			Vector <m>\uvec{x}</m> in <m>\R^n</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> if <m>A\uvec{x} = \lambda \uvec{x}</m>.
			Equivalently, <m>\uvec{x}</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> if <m>(\lambda I - A) \uvec{x} = \uvec{0}</m>.
		</li>
