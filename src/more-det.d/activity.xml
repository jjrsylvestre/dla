  <statement>
    <p>
    Recall that for matrix <m>A</m> and <em>elementary</em> matrix <m>E</m>, the result of <m>EA</m> is the same as the result of performing an elementary row operation on <m>A</m> (namely, the operation corresponding to <m>E</m>). Verify the formula
  	<me> \det (EA) = (\det E)(\det A) </me>
    for <em>each</em> of the three types of elementary matrices <m>E</m> (assuming <m>A</m> to be a square matrix of the same size as <m>E</m>).

    <paragraphs><title>Helpful notes</title>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
      To verify a formula, consider LHS and RHS <em>separately</em>, and argue that they equal the same value. Do <em>not</em> work with the proposed equality directly, since you don't <em>know</em> it's an equality yet.
      </li>
      <li>Do <em>not</em> just use examples; think abstractly instead.</li>
      <li>
      For each type of <m>E</m>, on the LHS consider the product of <em>matrices</em> <m>EA</m> and how its determinant compares to <m>\det A</m> using the rules for how row operations affect determinant (explored in the activities in <xref ref="section-det-by-row-red-activities"/>, and recalled for you at the top of this activity section). For this, think of <m>\det A = \det (\text{old})</m> and <m>\det (EA) = \det (\text{new})</m>. Then, on the RHS, consider the value of <m>\det E</m> and the corresponding product of <em>numbers</em> <m>(\det E)(\det A)</m>.

    <p>
    In this exercise, we will verify the general formula
    <me>\det (MN) = (\det M)(\det N)</me>
    in the case that <m>M</m> is invertible (assuming <m>M</m> and <m>N</m> to be square matrices of the same size).
  	<ol label="alph">
  		<li>
      <p>
      Recall that every invertible matrix can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices (<xref ref="theorem-elem-matrices-equiv-to-invertible" />). For now, suppose that <m>M</m> (which we have assumed invertible) can be expressed as a product of <em>three</em> elementary matrices, say <m>M = E_1 E_2 E_3</m>. Use the formula from
      <xref ref="activity-more-det-multiplicative-elem-version" />
      to verify that
  		<me> \det (E_1 E_2 E_3 N) = (\det E_1)(\det E_2)(\det E_3)(\det N). </me>
      </p>
      <hint><p>Start with the LHS and apply the formula <m>\det (EA) = (\det E)(\det A)</m> one step at a time. What are you using for <m>A</m> at each step?</p></hint>
      </li>
  		<li>
      Now use the formula from
      <xref ref="activity-more-det-multiplicative-elem-version" />
      to verify that
  		<me> (\det E_1)(\det E_2)(\det E_3)(\det N) = \bbrac{\det (E_1 E_2 E_3)}(\det N). </me>
      </li>
  		<li> Make sure you understand why parts (a) and (b) together verify that <me>\det (MN) = (\det M)(\det N)</me> for this <m>M</m>. </li>
  		<li> Do you think the calculations of the previous parts would work no matter how many <m>E_i</m>'s are required to express <m>M</m> as a product of elementary matrices? </li>

<activity xml:id="activity-more-det-det-inv">

    If matrix <m>A</m> is invertible, by definition this means that <m>A\inv{A} = I</m>.

      Starting with your answer to the previous part of this activity, use the formula <m>\det (MN) = (\det M)(\det N)</m> from <xref ref="activity-more-det-multiplicative-product-elem" /> to find a formula for <m>\det (\inv{A})</m> in terms of <m>\det A</m>.

        A fraction <m>1/A</m> does not make sense for matrices. However, <m>\det A</m> is just a number, so you can do all the normal algebra you would like with it!
