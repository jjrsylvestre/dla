	<p> The purpose of this book is to serve as supporting material for a fairly typical course in <em>Linear Algebra</em> using a discovery-based pedagogical approach. </p>

	<p>
	Each chapter is organized into sections titled
	<em>Activities</em>, <em>Terminology and notation</em>, <em>Concepts</em>, <em>Examples</em>, and <em>Theory</em>
	(though some chapters have additional <em>Motivation</em> and/or <em>More examples</em> sections).
	</p><p>
	The purpose for employing this uniform sectioning scheme is to give the student a uniform flow to encountering each new collection of topics:
	<dl>
		<li><title><em>Activities</em></title><p>
			initial encounter through discovery- and problem-solving-based activities;
		</p></li>
		<li><title><em>Terminology and notation</em></title><p>
		 introduction of the communication tools necessary to begin a more sophisticated conversation about the new topics;
	 	</p></li>
		<li><title><em>Concepts</em></title><p>
			fuller discussion of the new topics,
			grounded in reflections on the questions and results of the <em>Activities</em> section;
		</p></li>
		<li><title><em>Examples</em></title><p>
			computational examples to assist students with the procedural tasks related to the new topics,
			as well as additional examples that serve to illustrate certain concepts;
			and
		</p></li>
		<li><title><em>Theory</em></title><p>
			a more formal and general description of the concepts,
			with proofs.
		</p></li>
	</dl>
	Traditional textbooks usually intersperse
	terminology, concepts, examples, and theory
	in a linear narrative,
	and relegate <q>activities</q> to the <em>Exercises</em> section at the end of the chapter.
	By organizing the flow of learning in the above-described manner,
	it is hoped that the process of encountering and re-encountering
	(and <em>re</em>-encountering)
	the topics in different modes <mdash />
	discovery, reflection and discussion, examples, and theory <mdash />
	and at increasing levels of sophistication will lead to deeper learning.
	</p>

	<p>
	The organization of topics is fairly typical,
	under the choice of <q>late vectors</q>
	(though the term <term>column vector</term> is used informally in the early chapters).
	Systems of linear equations are used to motivate matrix theory,
	up through a basic treatment of determinants and the classical adjoint.
	Then vectors in <m>\R^n</m> are introduced as the initial model for how a <q>vector space</q> should behave,
	with an emphasis on a geometric understanding of the vector operations.
	A basic introduction to abstract vector spaces follows.
	Finally, the topic of matrix forms is broached by a simple treatment of eigenvalues/eigenvectors and diagonalization.
	Note that even though the concept of <term>similar matrices</term> is referenced in this final topic,
	the topic of <q>change of basis</q> has been omitted (see below),
	but will appear in future editions as these notes are expanded to include material for a second course in linear algebra.
	</p>

	<p>
	When using <em>discovery</em> as a pedagogical principal,
	it is not possible to cover as many topics,
	or to cover each topic with the same breadth,
	as in a breakneck-paced lecture class.
	The goal of these notes is not to teach students <em>a bunch of mathematics</em> in the particular topic of linear algebra,
	but instead to teach students <em>about mathematics</em> through the discovery of the beautiful and coherent subject of linear algebra.
	I have tried to distill each topic down to the necessary minimal core of concepts essential to the study of the subject,
	and have rejected inclusion of peripheral topics and facts or esoteric applications.
	I do not intend for these notes to be workable for everyone in every kind of linear algebra class.
	(But since they are released under an open license,
	they could of course be edited to make them workable for any kind of linear algebra course.)
