  <introduction><p>
  	Consider the matrices

    <statement><p>
      Compute <m>EA</m>. What is happening to <m>A</m> when it is multiplied by <m>E</m>?

		Do you think the same thing will happen when computing <m>E</m> times some other matrix?

  <task xml:id="activity-elem-matrices-intro-pattern"><p>
    We know that <m>EI = E</m>. But then consider <m>EI</m> in terms of the first two parts of this activity. So in terms of row operations, what is the relationship between <m>E</m> and <m>I</m>?
  </p></task>

<activity xml:id="activity-elem-matrices-intro-cont">
  <statement><p>
    Create a <m>3\times 3</m> matrix <m>E'</m> so that for every <m>3\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, the result of <m>E' A</m> is the same as applying the row operation <q>multiply row <m>3</m> by <m>-4</m>.</q>

    Create a <m>3\times 3</m> matrix <m>E''</m> so that for every <m>3 \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, the result of <m>E'' A</m> is the same as applying the row operation <q>swap rows <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>.</q>

<p>
Matrices <m>E,E',E''</m> from the activities so far are called <term>elementary matrices</term><idx><h>elementary</h><h>matrix</h></idx>. As the preceding activities demonstrate, every elementary row operation has a corresponding elementary matrix.

<activity xml:id="activity-elem-matrices-invert-method">
  <introduction><p>
    Consider
  	<m>
      B = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
        1 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
        0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\

  <task>
    <statement><p>
    Determine elementary matrices <m>E_1,E_2,E_3</m> so that <m>E_3 E_2 E_1 B</m> is the identity matrix.
    </p></statement>
		<hint><p>
    Use the connection between elementary matrices and row operations that we have discovered in this activity set. Consider carefully the order in which the elementary matrices should be multiplied onto <m>B</m>.
    </p></hint>

  <task xml:id="activity-elem-matrices-invert-method-by-elem-matrices"><p>
		The matrix <m>B</m> happens to be invertible. Manipulate the formula <m>E_3 E_2 E_1 B = I</m> algebraically to obtain a formula for <m>\inv{B}</m> involving your elementary matrices and <m>I</m>. (The <m>I</m> factor is not strictly necessary, but is important for the next step.)
  </p></task>
  <task xml:id="activity-elem-matrices-invert-method-by-row-red">
    <statement><p>
		Using your formula from part (b) as inspiration, come up with a procedure to use <em>only row reduction</em> (and not elementary matrices) to compute the inverse of a square matrix.
    </p></statement>
    <hint><p>
    Where did your elementary matrices <m>E_1,E_2,E_3</m> come from? And what are they now <q>doing</q> to the identity matrix, and in what order?
    </p></hint>

<activity xml:id="activity-elem-matrices-invert-2x2">
  <introduction><p>
    Consider the general <m>2\times 2</m> matrix
    <m>A = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}a \amp b\\c \amp d\end{smallmatrix}\right]</m>.
  </p></introduction>
  <task><p>
    Assume that <m>a\neq 0</m>. Use the method you developed in
    <xref ref="activity-elem-matrices-invert-method" />
    to determine the inverse of <m>A</m>.
  </p></task>
  <task><p> Did you need to assume anything about <m>ad-bc</m> for this to work? Why? </p></task>
  <task><p> Repeat for the other case: assume <m>a=0</m>. </p></task>
</activity>

<activity xml:id="activity-elem-matrices-invert-elem">
  <introduction><p>
    Complete the following tasks for each of the three types of elementary row operations, one at a time:
    <ol label="(i)">
    	<li> swap two rows;</li>
    	<li> multiply a row by a nonzero constant;</li>
    	<li> add a multiple of one row to another.</li>
    </ol>
  </p></introduction>
  <task xml:id="activity-elem-matrices-invert-elem-mystery-op"><p>
		Suppose someone has performed a single elementary row operation on a matrix, but they have only given you the <em>result</em> of this computation (as well as telling you <em>exactly</em> what row operation they performed). How can you recover the original matrix the person started with?
  </p></task>
  <task><p>
    Determine a general rule for the inverse of an elementary matrix of the type you are currently considering. You should be able to answer this directly, <em>without</em> using the method you developed in
    <xref ref="activity-elem-matrices-invert-method" />,
    by instead considering your answer to the previous step of this activity.
