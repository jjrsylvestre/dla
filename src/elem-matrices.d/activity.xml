Matrices <m>E,E',E''</m> from the activities so far are called <term>elementary matrices</term><!--\index{elementary!matrix}-->. As the preceding activities demonstrate, every elementary row operation has a corresponding elementary matrix.

    Complete the following two tasks for each of the three types of elementary row operations, one at a time:

  		Suppose someone has performed a single elementary row operation on a matrix, but they have only given you the <em>result</em> of this computation (as well as telling you <em>exactly</em> what row operation they performed). How can you recover the original matrix the person started with?

  		<li>
      Determine a general rule for the inverse of an elementary matrix of the type you are currently considering. You should be able to answer this directly, <em>without</em> using the method you developed in
      <xref ref="activity-elem-matrices-invert-method" />,
      by instead considering your answer to the previous step of this activity.
