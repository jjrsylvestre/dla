<title>Triangular-block nilpotent form</title>

<paragraphs><title>What</title><p>
	A block-diagonal matrix
	<me>
		\inv{P}AP
		= \begin{bmatrix}
			N_1 \\ \amp N_2 \\ \amp \amp \ddots \\ \amp \amp \amp N_s
		\end{bmatrix}
	</me>,
	where each block <m>N_i</m> is in elementary nilpotent form,
	and the blocks are arranged in order of size,
	<m>N_1</m> largest to <m>N_s</m> smallest.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>When</title><p> Matrix <m>A</m> is nilpotent. </p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>How</title>
	<p>
	Determine a complete set of independent subspaces of <m>\R^n</m>
	(or <m>\C^n</m>, as appropriate)
	that satisfy the following.
	Each subspace is a cyclic space for <m>A</m>,
	and has an <m>A</m>-cyclic basis whose last element lies in the null space of <m>A</m>.
	Order these subspaces by dimension, from largest to smallest.
	Take the first however many columns of <m>P</m> to be the cyclic basis vectors for the first (largest dimension) cyclic subspace,
	the next however many columns of <m>P</m> to be the cyclic basis vectors from the next subspace,
	and so on.
	</p>
	<!-- <aside><title>Note</title><p>
		The details of how to determine such cyclic subspaces are quite involved,
		and beyond the scope of this book.
	</p></aside> -->
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Result</title><p>
	The number of blocks, <m>s</m>, is equal to the nullity of <m>A</m>.
	The largest block, <m>N_1</m>,
	has dimensions <m>k\times k</m>,
	where <m>k</m> is the degree of nilpotency of the nilpotent matrix <m>A</m>.
	The sizes of the remaining blocks can be deduced from the ranks of the powers
	<m>A^{k-1}, A^{k-2}, \dotsc, A</m>,
	as described in <xref ref="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-indirect" />.
