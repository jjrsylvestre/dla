<title>Triangular-block form</title>

<paragraphs><title>What</title><p>
	A block-diagonal form matrix
	<me>
		\inv{P}AP
		= \begin{bmatrix} U_1 \\ \amp U_2 \\ \amp \amp \ddots \\ \amp \amp \amp U_\ell \end{bmatrix}
	</me>,
	where each block <m>U</m> corresponds to a specific eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> of <m>A</m>,
	has size equal to the algebraic multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m>,
	and is in scalar-triangular form with <m>\lambda</m> down the diagonal.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>When</title>
	<p>
	The characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m> factors completely as
	<me>
		c_A(\lambda)
		= (\lambda - \lambda_1)^{m_1}
		(\lambda - \lambda_2)^{m_2}
		\dotsm
		(\lambda - \lambda_\ell)^{m_\ell}
	</me>.
	</p>
	<aside><title>Note</title><p>
		If <m>A</m> is a complex matrix
		(or, at least, regarded as a complex matrix),
		then this condition is always true.
	</p></aside>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>How</title>
	<p>
	Follow the scalar-triangular form procedure
	(<xref ref="procedure-scalar-triang-concepts-proc" />)
	with <m>\lambda = \lambda_1</m>,
	but stop when you have <m>m_1</m> linearly independent vectors.
	Use these vectors as the first columns of <m>P</m>.
	Repeat with <m>\lambda = \lambda_2</m> to get the next <m>m_2</m> columns of <m>P</m>.
	And so on.
	</p>
	<aside><title>Recall</title><p>
		Each subcollection of vectors from applying the scalar-triangular form procedure for a specific eigenvalue <m>\lambda_j</m> will form a basis for the generalized eigenspace <m>G_{\lambda_j}(A)</m>.
	</p></aside>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Result</title><p>
	 Each block <m>U_j</m> will be as in the described result for
	 <xref ref="section-forms-summary-scalar-tri" text="title" />.
</p></paragraphs>
