<title>Jordan normal form</title>

<paragraphs><title>What</title><p>
	A block-diagonal matrix
	<me>
		\inv{P}AP
		= \begin{bmatrix} J_1 \\ \amp J_2 \\  \amp  \amp \ddots \\  \amp \amp \amp J_t \end{bmatrix}
	</me>,
	where each block <m>J_i</m> is a Jordan block.
	That is, each <m>J_i</m> is in (lower triangular) scalar-triangular form,
	with an eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> down the diagonal,
	such that <m>J_i - \lambda I</m> is in elementary nilpotent form.
	There can be multiple blocks corresponding to the same eigenvalue,
	but all blocks for a specific eigenvalue appear consecutively,
	ordered by size of the block, largest to smallest.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>When</title>
	<p>
	The characteristic polynomial of <m>A</m> factors completely as
	<me>
		c_A(\lambda)
		= (\lambda - \lambda_1)^{m_1}
		(\lambda - \lambda_2)^{m_2}
		\dotsm
		(\lambda - \lambda_\ell)^{m_\ell}
	</me>.
	</p>
	<aside><title>Note</title><p>
		If <m>A</m> is a complex matrix
		(or, at least, regarded as a complex matrix),
		then this condition is always true.
	</p></aside>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>How</title>
	<p>
	First, obtain a matrix <m>M</m> such that <m>U = \inv{M} A M</m> is in triangular block form.
	(See summary <xref ref="section-forms-summary-tri-block" />.)
	Write <m>U_1,U_2,\dotsc,U_\ell</m> for the blocks in <m>U</m>.
	The matrix <m>U_1</m> corresponds to eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1</m> of <m>A</m>,
	and has size <m>m_1 \times m_1</m>,
	where <m>m_1</m> is the algebraic multiplicity of <m>\lambda_1</m>.
	This matrix can be decomposed as
	<me> U_1 = \lambda_1 I + N_1 </me>,
	where <m>N_1</m> is an <m>m_1 \times m_1</m>, upper triangular, nilpotent matrix.
	Next, obtain a matrix <m>Q_1</m> such that <m>\inv{Q_1} N_1 Q_1</m> is in triangular-block nilpotent form.
	(See summary <xref ref="section-forms-summary-nilp-tri" />.)
	</p><p>
	Now repeat for <m>N_2</m>,
	where <me> U_2 = \lambda_2 I + N_2 </me>,
	to obtain <m>Q_2</m> such that <m>\inv{Q_2} N_2 Q_2</m> is in triangular-block nilpotent form.
	Then repeat for <m>N_3</m>,
	where <me> U_3 = \lambda_3 I + N_3 </me>,
	obtaining matrix <m>Q_3</m>.
	And so on.
	</p><p>
	Finally, take <m>P = M Q</m>, where
	<me>
		Q
		= \begin{bmatrix} Q_1 \\ \amp Q_2 \\ \amp \amp \ddots \\ \amp \amp \amp Q_\ell \end{bmatrix}
	</me>.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Result</title><p>
	Similar to the summary of triangular-block nilpotent form
	(<xref ref="section-forms-summary-nilp-tri" />),
	the number of blocks corresponding to a particular eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> is equal to the nullity of <m>A - \lambda I</m>
	(which is the same as the dimension of the eigenspace <m>E_\lambda(A)</m>).
	Write <m>m</m> for the algebraic multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m>.
	The largest (and first) block corresponding to <m>\lambda</m> has dimensions <m>k \times k</m>,
	where <m>k</m> is the smallest positive integer such that
	<me> \rank (A - \lambda I)^k = n-m </me>.
	(In other words, <m>k</m> is the degree of nilpotency of the nilpotent part of the <q>macro</q> triangular block corresponding to <m>\lambda</m>.)
	The sizes of the remaining Jordan blocks for <m>\lambda</m> can be deduced from the ranks of the powers
	<me> (A - \lambda I)^{k-1}, (A - \lambda I)^{k-2}, \dotsc, (A - \lambda I)^1 </me>.
