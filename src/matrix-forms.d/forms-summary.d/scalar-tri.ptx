<title>Scalar-triangular form</title>

<paragraphs><title>What</title><p>
	Upper triangular with repeated <m>\lambda</m> down the diagonal:
	<me>
		\inv{P}AP
		= \begin{bmatrix}
			\lambda\\
			\amp \lambda \amp \amp \ast  \\
			\amp \amp \ddots  \\
			\amp 0 \amp \amp \lambda \\
			\amp \amp \amp \amp \lambda
		\end{bmatrix}
	</me>.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>When</title><p> Matrix <m>A</m> has a single eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> with algebraic multiplicity <m>n</m>. </p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>How</title><p>
	Compute a basis for the eigenspace <m>E_\lambda(A)</m>
	(which is the null space of <m>\lambda I - A</m>),
	and use these as the first columns of <m>P</m>.
	If this has not produced enough columns for <m>P</m>,
	compute a basis for the next generalized eigensubspace <m>E^2_\lambda(A)</m>
	(which is the null space of <m>(\lambda I - A)^2</m>).
	Choose as many new vectors as possible from this basis that remain linearly independent when lumped together with the already chosen basis vectors from <m>E_\lambda(A)</m>.
	Use these new vectors as the next columns of <m>P</m>.
	If this still has not produced enough columns for <m>P</m>,
	continue by adding vectors from a basis for <m>E^3_\lambda(A)</m>,
	then from <m>E^4_\lambda(A)</m>,
	and so on.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Result</title><p>
	 The entries along the diagonal are the eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>.
	 The entries <em>above</em> the diagonal in the <m>\nth[j]</m> column of <m>\inv{P} A P</m> are precisely the scalars required to express <m>(A - \lambda I)\uvec{p}_j</m> as a linear combination of <m>\uvec{p}_1,\dotsc,\uvec{p}_{j-1}</m>.
