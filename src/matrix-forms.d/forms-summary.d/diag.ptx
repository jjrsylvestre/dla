<title>Diagonal form</title>

<paragraphs><title>What</title><p> <m>\inv{P}AP = D</m>, a diagonal matrix. </p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>When</title><p>
	Each eigenvalue of <m>A</m> has its algebraic multiplicity equal to its geometric multiplicity.
	Additionally, if <m>A</m> is a real matrix and we would like both <m>P</m> and <m>D</m> to be real matrices,
	then we also need <m>A</m> to <em>not</em> have any complex eigenvalues.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>How</title><p>
	Compute a basis for each eigenspace.
	Put these bases together into the columns of <m>P</m>.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Result</title><p>
	If the <m>\nth[j]</m> column of <m>P</m> is an eigenvector for eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>,
	then the <m>\nth[j]</m> diagonal entry of <m>D</m> will be <m>\lambda</m>.
