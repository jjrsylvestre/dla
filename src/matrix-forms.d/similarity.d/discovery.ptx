<title>Discovery guide</title>

<introduction><p>
	In <xref ref="chapter-diagonalization" />,
	we were interested in determining the conditions under which a square matrix is <term>similar</term> to a diagonal matrix
	(<ie /> is <term>diagonalizable</term>).
	In this discovery guide,
	we'll explore similarity more generally, both geometrically and algebraically.
</p></introduction>

<activity xml:id="activity-similarity-equiv-rel">
	<introduction><p>
		Recall that square matrices <m>A,B</m> are called <term>similar</term> if there exists an invertible matrix <m>P</m> so that
		<me> \inv{P} A P = B </me>.
	</p></introduction>
	<task>
		<p>
		The equality defining <term>similar matrices</term> seems <em>one-directional</em>:
		in the above, it would seem more appropriate to say that
		<em>matrix <m>A</m> is <term>similar to</term> matrix <m>B</m></em> via the transition matrix <m>P</m>,
		rather than saying that they are <em>similar together</em>.
		</p><p>
		Convince yourself that this distinction is not important by verifying that if <m>A</m> is similar to <m>B</m>,
		then <m>B</m> is also similar to <m>A</m>:
		<me> \inv{(<fillin characters="3" />)} B (<fillin characters="3" />) = A </me>.
		</p>
	</task>
	<task><p>
		Fill in the blanks to prove that every square matrix is similar to itself:
		<me> \inv{(<fillin characters="3" />)} A (<fillin characters="3" />) = A </me>.
	</p></task>
	<task>
		<p>
		Suppose <m>A,B</m> are similar via <m>P</m> as above,
		and that <m>B</m> is also similar to a third matrix <m>C</m> via transition matrix <m>Q</m>,
		<ie /> <m>\inv{Q} B Q = C</m>.
		</p><p>
		Fill in the blanks to verify that <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> must also be similar:
		<me> \inv{(<fillin characters="3" />)} A (<fillin characters="3" />) = C </me>.
		</p>
	</task>
</activity>

<aside><title>Terminology</title><p>
	In set theory,
	the three properties of similarity established above are called
	<term>symmetry</term>, <term>reflexivity</term>, and <term>transitivity</term>, respectively.
	All three together demonstrate that similarity is an <term>equivalence relation</term> on square matrices.

		</p><p>
		For this activity, assume we are working with <m>3 \times 3</m> matrices.
		</p>
	</introduction>
	<task xml:id="activity-similarity-algebraic-LHS"><p>
		Think of <m>P</m> as made up of three columns:

			P = \begin{bmatrix}

		If we analyzed and compared the second columns of <m>A P</m> and <m>P B</m> in the same fashion,
