<title>Similarity is an equivalence relation</title>

<p>
We will record here the result of
<xref ref="activity-similarity-equiv-rel" />
without proof,
as we have already justified it in that activity.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-similarity-equiv-rel"><statement><p>
	Similarity is an equivalence relation on square matrices of a particular size.
	That is, similarity is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
</p></statement></theorem>

<p>
As discussed in
<xref ref="subsection-similarity-concepts-classes" />,
<xref ref="theorem-similarity-equiv-rel" />
implies that similarity partitions <m>\matrixring_n(\C)</m> into <term>similarity classes</term>.
There are some special similarity classes,
which explains our initial focus on diagonal form
(<xref ref="chapter-diagonalization" />)
as the first <q>simple</q> form of interest.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-similarity-scalar-sim-classes">
	<title>Scalar similarity classes</title>
	<statement><p> The similarity class of a scalar matrix contains only that matrix. </p></statement>
	<proof><title>Proof idea</title><p>
		All that is required is to prove that a scalar matrix <m>k I</m> can <em>only</em> be similar to itself.
		That is, if <m>B \similar k I</m> is true, then it must in fact be that <m>B = kI</m>.
		We leave the details to you, the reader.
	</p></proof>
</proposition>

<remark><p> Note that this proposition applies to both the zero matrix <m>\zerovec = 0 I</m> and the identity matrix <m>I = 1 I</m>. </p></remark>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-similarity-theory-props">
<title>Properties of similar matrices</title>

<p> Now we'll state and prove the properties of similar matrices that can be transferred from one to the other via a transition matrix that realizes the similarity. </p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-similarity-powers">
	<title>Powers of similar are similar</title>
	<statement><p>
		If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar,
		then so are <m>A^k</m> and <m>B^k</m> for every positive integer <m>k</m>.
		If, in addition, we assume that one of <m>A,B</m> is invertible,
		then the other must be as well,
		and we may expand our first claim to include <em>every</em> integer <m>k</m>.
	</p></statement>
	<proof>
		<p> Assume <m>B = \inv{P} A P</m>. </p>
		<case><title>Case of positive <m>k</m></title><p>
			We have
			<me> B^k = (\inv{P} A P)^k = (\inv{P} A P) (\inv{P} A P) (\inv{P} A P) \dotsm (\inv{P} A P), </me>
			where the expression on the right has <m>k</m> factors of <m>(\inv{P} A P)</m>.
			By associativity, rearrange the brackets:
			<me> B^k = \inv{P} A (P \inv{P}) A (P \inv{P}) A (P \dotsm \inv{P}) A P </me>.
			Each factor of <m>P \inv{P}</m> is equal to the identity matrix,
			and the identity matrix has no effect in matrix multiplication.
			Thus,
			<me> B^k = \inv{P} A A A \dotsm A P, </me>
			where there are <m>k</m> factors of <m>A</m>,
			since we started with <m>k</m> factors of <m>(\inv{P} A P)</m>.
			We now have <m>B^k = \inv{P} A^k P</m>,
			showing that <m>A^k</m> and <m>B^k</m> are similar, as desired.
		</p></case>
		<p>
		If we assume that <m>A</m> is invertible,
		then so is <m>B</m> since it is equal to the product of invertible matrices <m>\inv{P}</m>, <m>A</m>, and <m>P</m>
		(<xref ref="proposition-inverses-props-of-inverses-inverse-extended-product">Statement</xref>
		of
		<xref ref="proposition-inverses-props-of-inverses" />).
		If we instead assume that <m>B</m> is invertible,
		then we can make the same argument using expression <m>A = P B \inv{P}</m> to conclude that <m>A</m> is invertible as well.
		</p><p>
		For the remainder of the cases of showing similarity of powers of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
		assume that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are both invertible.
		</p>
		<case><title>Case of <m>k = 0</m></title><p>
			By convention, both <m>A^0 = I</m> and <m>B^0 = I</m>,
			and the identity matrix is similar to itself.
		</p></case>
		<case><title>Case of <m>k = -1</m></title><p>
			Demonstrating similarity of <m>\inv{A}</m> and <m>\inv{B}</m> is straightforward,
			and we leave it to you, the reader.
		</p></case>
		<case><title>Case of <m>k <lt /> -1</m></title><p>
			Write <m>k = - m</m> for <m>m</m> a positive integer.
			If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar,
			then so are <m>\inv{A}</m> and <m>\inv{B}</m> by a previous case.
			But then so are positive powers of <m>\inv{A}</m> and <m>\inv{B}</m>,
			also by a previous case.
			In particular, the matrices
			<md><mrow>
				\bigl(\inv{A}\bigr)^m \amp = A^{-m} = A^k \text{,} \amp
				\bigl(\inv{B}\bigr)^m \amp = B^{-m} = B^k

			are similar.
		</p></case>
	</proof>
</proposition>

<proposition>
	<statement><p>
		Assume <m>B = \inv{P} A P</m>.

			<m>A (P \uvec{x}) = P \uvec{b}</m> is consistent,
			which means that <m>P \uvec{b}</m> is in the column space of <m>A</m>.
		</li>
	</ol></p></proof>
</proposition>

<p>
The following corollary follows from the proposition due to the fact that the transition matrix <m>P</m> is invertible.
We will just state this corollary without proof.
</p>

<corollary xml:id="corollary-similarity-rank-nullity">
	<title>Rank and nullity of similar matrices</title>
	<statement><p>
		If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar matrices then the dimensions of the null spaces of the two matrices are equal,
		and also the dimensions of the column spaces of the two matrices are equal.
		In other words, similar matrices have the same nullity and rank.
	</p></statement>
</corollary>

<p> Now we work toward relating eigenvalues and eigenvectors between similar matrices. </p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-similarity-similar-same-det">
	<!-- TODO add same trace? -->
	<statement><p> Similar matrices have the same determinant. </p></statement>
	<proof><title>Proof idea</title><p>
		Assuming <m>B = \inv{P} A P</m>, begin with <m>\det B = \det (\inv{P} A P)</m>, and use
		<xref ref="proposition-more-det-product-many-matrices">Statement</xref>
		of
		<xref ref="proposition-more-det-product" />
		and
		<xref ref="proposition-more-det-inverse" />
		to simplify.
	</p></proof>
</proposition>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-similarity-similar-same-char-poly-evals-transformed-evecs">
	<statement><p>
		Similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial,
		hence also the same eigenvalues with the same algebraic multiplicities.
		Moreover,
		if <m>B = \inv{P} A P</m>,
		then for each shared eigenvalue the transition matrix <m>P</m> transforms eigenvectors of <m>B</m> into eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.
	</p></statement>
	<proof><title>Proof idea</title><p>
		Assume <m>B = \inv{P} A P</m>.
		Then using this similarity relation and the identity <m>\inv{P} P = I</m>,
		one can show that <m>\lambda I - B = \inv{P} (\lambda I - A) P</m> as well.
		Thus the matrices <m>\lambda I - B</m> and <m>\lambda I - A</m> are also similar,
		and hence have the same determinant
		(<xref ref="proposition-similarity-similar-same-det" />).
		Therefore, the characteristic polynomial of <m>B</m> is the same as that of <m>A</m>.
		And since the eigenvalues of a matrix are precisely the roots of its characteristic polynomial,
		these similar matrices must also have the same eigenvalues.
		</p><p>
		Finally, suppose <m>\uvec{x}_0</m> is an eigenvector of <m>B</m> corresponding to eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>.
		By definition, this means <me>B \uvec{x}_0 = \lambda \uvec{x}_0</me>.
		Substitute the similarity relation for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> and rearrange to <me>A (P \uvec{x}_0) = \lambda (P \uvec{x}_0)</me>,
		which says that <m>P \uvec{x}_0</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> corresponding to eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>.
	</p></proof>
</theorem>

<p>
Similarly to null spaces and column spaces of similar matrices above,
the following corollary follows from the theorem due to the fact that the transition matrix <m>P</m> is invertible.
We will also just state this corollary without proof.
</p>

<corollary><statement><p>
	If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are similar matrices and <m>\lambda</m> is a shared eigenvalue of these two matrices,
	then the eigenspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m> has the same dimension as the eigenspace of <m>B</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m>.
	In other words,
	the geometric multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> as an eigenvalue of <m>A</m> is the same as the geometric multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m> as an eigenvalue of <m>B</m>.
</p></statement></corollary>
