<title>Motivation</title>

<p>
We continue our quest to answer
<xref ref="question-block-diag-motivation-similarity-class-reps" />.
</p>

<p>
In <xref ref="chapter-block-diag" />
and
<xref ref="chapter-scalar-triang" />,
we took two different paths from the initial case of diagonalizable matrices.
In the former we generalized from diagonal to <em>roughly</em> diagonal in blocks,
and in the latter we moved from diagonal form to triangular form,
albeit a particularly simple example of it.
In this chapter, we merge the two branches back together.

<paragraphs><title>Philosophy of inquiry: boldly forge ahead using whatever tools worked before</title><p>
	Apply the tools we have already developed in previous cases to see what works and what doesn't,
	with the hope that we'll be able to adjust whatever doesn't work.
</p></paragraphs>

<p>
Generalized eigenvectors were central to handling the case of scalar-triangular form,
where we assumed each matrix had a single repeated eigenvalue.
Can we still use generalized eigenvectors to achieve a triangular form for matrices with more than one eigenvalue?
In that case we will be dealing with several different generalized eigenspaces.
Block-diagonal form gives us a way to break the action of <m>A</m> on <m>\R^n</m> (or <m>\C^n</m>)
into its action on each in a collection of smaller subspaces.
We know that eigenspaces are always <m>A</m>-invariant
(<xref ref="proposition-block-diag-eigenspace-invariant" />)
and form an independent set
(<xref ref="theorem-block-diag-eigenspace-independent" />).
Will generalized eigenspaces do the same?
Let's find out.
