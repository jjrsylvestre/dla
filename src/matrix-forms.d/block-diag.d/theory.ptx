<title>Properties of block-diagonal form</title>

<p>
First, we'll record some of the properties of block-diagonal matrices explored in the latter part of
<xref ref="worksheet-block-diag" />.
As we have sufficiently explored most of these patterns in <xref ref="worksheet-block-diag" />,
we state these properties without proof.

<title>Invariant subspaces</title>

<p>
As usual, to understand a subspace it is enough to understand a spanning set for the subspace,
and this is true for invariant subspaces as well.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-block-diag-invariant-by-spanning-set">
	<statement><p>
		Suppose <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix, and

			Since each of the spanning vectors <m>\uvec{w}_1,\uvec{w}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{w}_\ell</m> lies in <m>W</m>,

			Assume that each of the vectors <m>A\uvec{w}_1,A\uvec{w}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{w}_\ell</m> lies in <m>W</m>.
			We must prove that for <em>every</em> vector <m>\uvec{w}</m> in <m>W</m>,
			the vector <m>A\uvec{w}</m> will again lie in <m>W</m>.
			Since <m>\{\uvec{w}_1,\dotsc,\uvec{w}_\ell\}</m>

Here is a special example of an invariant subspace that will become important in our further study of matrix forms.

<subsection xml:id="subsection-block-diag-theory-independent">
<title>Independent subspaces</title>

<p>
Here is a special case of testing independence of subspaces,
in the case of two subspaces.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-block-diag-pair-indep-subsp-iff-zero-intersect">

	<statement><p>
		Subspaces <m>W_1,W_2</m> of a finite dimensional vector space are independent if and only if <m>W_1 \cap W_2 = \{\zerovec\}</m>.
	</p></statement>

	<proof>

		<p>
		Again, with an <q>if and only if</q> statement, there are two things to prove.
		In both cases, begin with bases
		<md>
			<mrow> \basisfont{B}_1 \amp = \{ \uvec{u}_1, \uvec{u}_2, \dotsc, \uvec{u}_{d_1} \} \text{,} </mrow>
			<mrow> \basisfont{B}_2 \amp = \{ \uvec{w}_1, \uvec{w}_2, \dotsc, \uvec{w}_{d_2} \} \text{,} </mrow>
		</md>
		for <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m>, respectively,
		where <m>d_1 = \dim W_1</m> and <m>d_2 = \dim W_2</m>.
		</p>

		<case direction="forward">
			<!-- <title>(<m>\Rightarrow</m>)</title> -->

			<p>
			Assume that <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m> are independent.
			By definition, this means that the combined set
			<me> \{ \uvec{u}_1, \dotsc, \uvec{u}_{d_1}, \uvec{w}_1, \dotsc, \uvec{w}_{d_2} \} </me>
			is linearly independent.
			</p>

			<p>
			We must prove that <m>W_1 \cap W_2 = \{\zerovec\}</m>.
			So suppose <m>\uvec{v}</m> lies in the intersection <m>W_1 \cap W_2</m>.
			If we are to prove that <m>W_1\cap W_2</m> consists of <em>only</em> the zero vector,
			then we must prove that <m>\uvec{v} = \zerovec</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
			Since <m>\uvec{v}</m> is in <m>W_1</m>,
			there exist scalars
			<m>a_1, a_2, \dotsc,a_{d_1}</m>
			such that <me> \uvec{v} = a_1 \uvec{u}_1 + a_2 \uvec{u}_2 + \dotsb + a_{d_1} \uvec{u}_{d_1} </me>.
			But <m>\uvec{v}</m> also lies in <m>W_2</m>,
			and so there exist scalars
			<m>b_1, b_2, \dotsc, b_{d_2}</m>
			such that <me> \uvec{v} = b_1 \uvec{w}_1 + b_2 \uvec{w}_2 + \dotsb + b_{d_2} \uvec{w}_{d_2} </me>.
			Now, from the vector space identity <m>\uvec{v} - \uvec{v} = \zerovec</m>,
			we can subtract these two linear combination expressions for <m>\uvec{v}</m> to get
			<me>
				a_1 \uvec{u}_1 + a_2 \uvec{u}_2 + \dotsb + a_{d_1} \uvec{u}_{d_1}
				+ (-b_1) \uvec{w}_1 + (-b_2) \uvec{w}_2 + \dotsb + (-b_{d_2}) \uvec{w}_{d_2}
				= \zerovec
			</me>.
			Linear independence of the combined set of basis vectors says that all of the scalars above are zero, so that
			<me>
				\uvec{v} = 0 \uvec{u}_1 + 0 \uvec{u}_2 + \dotsb + 0 \uvec{u}_{d_1}
				= 0 \uvec{w}_1 + 0 \uvec{w}_2 + \dotsb + 0 \uvec{w}_{d_2}
				= \zerovec
			</me>,
			as desired.
			</p>

		</case>

		<case direction="backward">
			<!-- <title>(<m>\Leftarrow</m>)</title> -->

			<p>
			Assume that <m>W_1 \cap W_2 = \{\zerovec\}</m>.
			We must prove that <m>W_1,W_2</m> are independent.
			That is, we need to verify that the combined collection
			<m>\{ \uvec{u}_1, \dotsc, \uvec{u}_{d_1}, \uvec{w}_1, \dotsc, \uvec{w}_{d_2} \}</m>
			remains linearly independent.
			</p>

			<p>
			Setting up the test for linear independence,
			we assume that
			<md><mrow xml:id="equation-block-diag-theory-indep-subsp-iff-zero-intersect-test" tag="star">
				a_1 \uvec{u}_1 + a_2 \uvec{u}_2 + \dotsb + a_{d_1} \uvec{u}_{d_1}
				+ b_1 \uvec{w}_1 + b_2 \uvec{w}_2 + \dotsb + b_{d_2} \uvec{w}_{d_2}
				= \zerovec
			</mrow></md>
			Set <me> \uvec{v} = a_1 \uvec{u}_1 + a_2 \uvec{u}_2 + \dotsb + a_{d_1} \uvec{u}_{d_1} </me>.
			Then <m>\uvec{v}</m> is in <m>W_1</m>.
			But by moving all the <m>\uvec{w}_j</m> terms to the other side
			of <xref ref="equation-block-diag-theory-indep-subsp-iff-zero-intersect-test" />,
			we obtain a second expression for <m>\uvec{v}</m>,
			<me> \uvec{v} = - b_1 \uvec{w}_1 - b_2 \uvec{w}_2 - \dotsb - b_{d_2} \uvec{w}_{d_2} </me>,
			so that <m>\uvec{v}</m> is also in <m>W_2</m>.
			Therefore, <m>\uvec{v} \in W_1 \cap W_2</m>.
			By assumption, this intersection contains <em>only</em> the zero vector,
			so we must have <m>\uvec{v} = \zerovec</m>.
			Our two different expressions for <m>\uvec{v}</m> as linear combinations lead to
			<md>
				<mrow> a_1 \uvec{u}_1 + a_2 \uvec{u}_2 + \dotsb + a_{d_1} \uvec{u}_{d_1} = \zerovec \text{,} </mrow>
				<mrow> (-b_1) \uvec{w}_1 + (-b_2) \uvec{w}_2 + \dotsb + (-b_{d_2}) \uvec{w}_{d_2} = \zerovec \text{.} </mrow>
			</md>
			These expressions are essentially the test for linear independence,
			one for basis <m>\basisfont{B}_1</m> and one for basis <m>\basisfont{B}_2</m>.
			As each of these bases must be an independent set,
			these two tests for independence lead to the conclusions
			<md alignment="gather">
				<mrow> a_1 = a_2 = \dotsb = a_{d_1} \text{,} </mrow>
				<mrow> b_1 = b_2 = \dotsb = b_{d_2} \text{.} </mrow>
			</md>
			So, in fact, all of the coefficients in
			<xref ref="equation-block-diag-theory-indep-subsp-iff-zero-intersect-test" />
			must be zero, and the test for independence has been confirmed.
			</p>

		</case>

	</proof>

</theorem>

<warning><p>
	The condition <m>W_1 \cap W_2 = \{\zerovec\}</m> is <em>not</em> saying that the intersection of <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m> is empty!
	In fact, it is impossible for two subspaces of any vector space to be disjoint
	(<ie /> have empty intersection),
	since <em>every</em> subspace of a vector space contains the zero vector.
	The condition <m>W_1 \cap W_2 = \{\zerovec\}</m> is saying that the intersection of <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m> contains <em>only</em> the zero vector.

Can independent subsets always be <q>completed</q> to a complete set of independent subspaces?
