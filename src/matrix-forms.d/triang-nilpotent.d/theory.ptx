<title>Theory</title>

<p> Here we'll formally state some of the patterns we've encountered in this chapter. </p>

<p> First, let's note that a nilpotent matrix can always be put into triangular-block nilpotent form. </p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-triang-nilpotent-cyclic-decomp">

	<statement><p>
		If <m>A</m> is a nilpotent matrix,
		then there exists an invertible matrix <m>P</m> such that <m>\inv{P} A P</m> is in triangular-block nilpotent form.
	</p></statement>

	<proof>
		<title>Proof idea</title>

		<p>
		Essentially, the existence of <m>P</m> is implied by the fact that we can write down procedures for computing such a <m>P</m>.
		(See <xref ref="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-proc" />.)
		<!-- (<xref ref="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc1" /> or <xref ref="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc2" />). -->
		However, it might take some convincing that the procedures we have written down do what they claim to do.
		</p>

		<p>
		For a different perspective, see the topic of <em>cyclic decomposition</em> in
		<xref ref="reference-hoff-kunze,reference-roman-adv-linear-alg" />.
		</p>

	</proof>
</theorem>

<p>
Once we know the form <m>N = \inv{P} A P</m> exists,
it is possible to use the properties of <m>N</m> to identify properties of <m>A</m> that will help us determine <m>P</m>.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-triang-nilp-block-props">

	<statement><p>
		Suppose that <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> nilpotent matrix that is similar to the triangular-block nilpotent form <m>N</m>.
		Then the following hold.
		<ol>

			<li>
				The number of blocks in <m>N</m> is equal to <m>\nullity A</m>,
				the dimension of the null space of <m>A</m>.
			</li>

			<li>
				The largest (<ie /> first) block in <m>N</m> has size <m>k \times k</m>,
				where <m>k</m> is the degree of nilpotency of <m>A</m>,
				and <m>N</m> has <m>\rank (A^{k-1})</m> blocks of this size.
			</li>

		</ol>
	</p></statement>

	<proof><p><ol>

		<li>
			For this statement,
			consider that <m>N</m> is <em>almost</em> in RREF;
			we would only need to swap some rows to put it in RREF.
			Therefore, the rank of <m>N</m> is equal to the number of ones that appear in it.
			Each elementary block of <m>N</m> is just a single one away from having full rank.
			That is, if <m>N</m> has a block of size <m>m \times m</m>,
			that block contributes exactly <m>(m-1)</m> to the rank of <m>N</m>.
			Thus, the number of blocks in <m>N</m> is equal to how far <m>N</m> is from having full rank <m>n</m>:
			<me> \rank N = n - (\text{ # of blocks in } N) </me>.
			We now have that the number of blocks in <m>N</m> is equal to <m>n - \rank N</m>,
			which is equal to <m>\nullity N</m> by
			the <xref ref="theorem-col-row-null-space-rank-nullity" text="title"/>.
			Finally, since <m>A</m> and <m>N</m> are similar,
			they have the same nullity (<xref ref="corollary-similarity-rank-nullity" />),
			and so we could say that the number of blocks in <m>N</m> is equal to <m>\nullity A</m>.
		</li>

		<li>

			<p>
			For this statement, first recall that similar nilpotent matrices have the same degree of nilpotency
			(<xref ref="proposition-cayley-hamilton-similar-to-nilpotent" />),
			so <m>N</m> first becomes zero when <m>A</m> does.
			Powers of <m>N</m> can be computed by taking powers of its blocks
			(<xref ref="proposition-block-diag-props-products-powers">Statement</xref>
			of <xref ref="proposition-block-diag-props" />),
			and we know that powers of each elementary block will become zero precisely at the block's size
			(see <xref ref="activity-elem-nilpotent-first-encounter" />).
			Since a power of <m>N</m> will be zero precisely when each of its blocks is zero at that power,
			we can conclude that degree of nilpotency of <m>N</m>
			(and hence of <m>A</m>)
			is equal to the size of the largest block in <m>N</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
			It still remains to determine the number of blocks of largest size <m>k \times k</m>,
			where <m>k</m> is the common degree of nilpotency of <m>N</m> and <m>A</m>.
			For this, consider the matrix <m>N^{k-1}</m>.
			At this power, all blocks of smaller size will still become zero.
			But each block of size <m>k \times k</m>,
			raised to the power <m>k-1</m>,
			will consist of all zeros <em>except</em> for a single one in the lower left entry
			(again see <xref ref="activity-elem-nilpotent-first-encounter" />).
			Therefore, each block of size <m>k \times k</m> contributes a single one to the rank of <m>N^{k-1}</m>,
			and each block of smaller size contributes nothing.
			Thus, <m>\rank(N^{k-1})</m> counts the number of blocks of <m>N</m> of size <m>k \times k</m>.
			Finally, since <m>A</m> is similar to <m>N</m>,
			so also <m>A^{k-1}</m> is similar to <m>N^{k-1}</m>
			(<xref ref="proposition-similarity-powers" />).
			Therefore, <m>\rank(A^{k-1}) = \rank(N^{k-1})</m>,
			and so we could also say that <m>\rank(A^{k-1})</m> counts the number of blocks of <m>N</m> of size <m>k \times k</m>.
			</p>

		</li>

	</ol></p></proof>

</theorem>

<remark><p>
	As we have seen in <xref ref="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-indirect" />
	and <xref ref="subsection-triang-nilpotent-examples-indirect" />,
	it is possible to expand the above list of properties:
	the ranks of the powers of <m>A</m> tell us exactly the form of <m>N</m>.
</p></remark>

<p>
The following fact makes it easier to check whether our <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces are independent.
<!-- We used this as part of our strategy in <xref ref="example-triang-nilpotent-proc-9x9" />. -->
Note that the statement is true even in the case that <m>A</m> is not nilpotent.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-triang-nilpotent-indep-cyclic-with-last-vector-null">

	<statement><p>
		Suppose that <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix
		and <m>W_1, W_2, \dotsc, W_\ell</m> is a collection of <m>A</m>-cyclic subspaces of <m>\R^n</m>
		(or <m>\C^n</m>, as appropriate)
		each of which has a cyclic basis whose last element lies in the null space of <m>A</m>.
		Then the collection <m>W_1,W_2,\dotsc,W_\ell</m> is independent if and only if the collection of final vectors in each of these cyclic bases forms a linearly independent set in the null space <m>A</m>.
	</p></statement>

	<proof>
		<title>Proof outline</title>

		<p>
		If the spaces <m>W_1,W_2,\dotsc,W_\ell</m> are independent,
		then by definition their bases taken all together remain linearly independent.
		Since a subcollection of an independent set is still independent
		(<xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-sub-super-sets-subset-indep">Statement</xref>
		of <xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-sub-super-sets" />),
		it follows that the collection of final null space vectors taken from each cyclic basis will remain independent.
		</p><p>
		Now consider the reverse implication.
		We will prove this statement in the case of two cyclic spaces,
		<m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m>.
		(The proof in the case of more than two spaces is similar, but much more tedious.)
		The proof we give is similar to the independence argument in the proof of
		<xref ref="theorem-elem-nilpotent-cyclic-basis-terminating-in-zero" />.
		</p>

		<p>
		Suppose
		<me> \{ \uvec{u}, A\uvec{u}, \dotsc, A^{k-1} \uvec{u} \} </me>
		is a cylic basis for <m>W_1</m> and
		<me> \{ \uvec{v}, A\uvec{v}, \dotsc, A^{m-1} \uvec{v} \} </me>
		is a cylic basis for <m>W_2</m>.
		Further assume that
		<me> \{ A^{k-1} \uvec{u}, A^{m-1} \uvec{v} \} </me>
		is a linearly independent set contained in the null space of <m>A</m>.
		Note that these vectors being in the null space means that
		<me> A^k \uvec{u} = \zerovec, \qquad A^m \uvec{v} = \zerovec. </me>
		</p>

		<case><title>Case <m>m=k</m></title><p>
			We wish to show that the union of the two cyclic bases forms a linearly independent set.
			Using the <xref ref="proposition-linear-indep-test" text="title" />,
			assume that
			<me>
				a_0 \uvec{u} + a_1 A \uvec{u} + \dotsb + a_{k-1} A^{k-1} \uvec{u}
				+ b_0 \uvec{v} + b_1 A \uvec{v} + \dotsb + b_{k-1} A^{k-1} \uvec{v}
				= \zerovec
			</me>.
			We wish to show that all of the scalars in the above linear combination are zero.
			First, multiply each side of the equation by <m>A^{k-1}</m>.
			Since <me>A^k \uvec{u} = A^k \uvec{v} = \zerovec</me>,
			this eliminates all of the terms except the <m>a_0</m> and <m>b_0</m> terms,
			leaving
			<me> a_0 A^{k-1} \uvec{u} + b_0 A^{k-1} \uvec{v} = \zerovec </me>.
			However, we have assumed that <m>A^{k-1} \uvec{u}</m> and <m>A^{k-1} \uvec{v}</m> are linearly independent.
			Therefore, we must have <m>a_0 = b_0 = 0</m>,
			leaving
			<me>
				a_1 A \uvec{u} + \dotsb + a_{k-1} A^{k-1} \uvec{u}
				+ b_1 A \uvec{v} + \dotsb + b_{k-1} A^{k-1} \uvec{v}
				= \zerovec
			</me>
			in the original homogeneous vector equation.
			Multiplying both sides of this new equation by <m>A^{k-2}</m>,
			we can use the same argument to conclude that <m>a_1 = b_1 = 0</m>.
			Continuing in this fashion, we can argue that all the coefficients are zero.
		</p></case>

		<case><title>Case <m>m \gt k</m></title><p>
			Again, assume that
			<me>
				a_0 \uvec{u} + a_1 A \uvec{u} + \dotsb + a_{k-1} A^{k-1} \uvec{u}
				+ b_0 \uvec{v} + b_1 A \uvec{v} + \dotsb + b_{m-1} A^{m-1} \uvec{v}
				= \zerovec
			</me>.
			Multiply both sides of this equation by <m>A^{m-1}</m>.
			Since <m>m \gt k</m>,
			this will eliminate <em>all</em> of the <m>\uvec{u}</m> terms,
			and just leave <m>b_0 A^{m-1} \uvec{v} = \zerovec</m>.
			Since <m>A^{m-1} \uvec{v}</m> is part of a basis, it cannot be zero, hence <m>b_0 = 0</m>.
			We are then left with
			<me>
				a_0 \uvec{u} + a_1 A \uvec{u} + \dotsb + a_{k-1} A^{k-1} \uvec{u}
				+ b_1 A \uvec{v} + \dotsb + b_{m-1} A^{m-1} \uvec{v}
				= \zerovec
			</me>
			in the original homogeneous vector equation.
			Continuing in this fashion,
			we can argue that <m>b_0 = b_1 = \dotsb = b_{m-k-1} = 0</m>,
			leaving
			<md>
				<mrow>
					a_0 \uvec{u} \amp + a_1 A \uvec{u} + \dotsb + a_{k-1} A^{k-1} \uvec{u}
				</mrow><mrow>
					\amp + b_{m-k} A^{m-k} \uvec{v} + b_{m-k+1} A^{m-k+1} \uvec{v} + \dotsb + b_{m-1} A^{m-1} \uvec{v}
					= \zerovec
				</mrow>
			</md>.
			If we set <m>\uvec{v}' = A^{m-k}\uvec{v}</m>,
			we then have
			<md>
				<mrow>
					a_0 \uvec{u} \amp + a_1 A \uvec{u} + \dotsb + a_{k-1} A^{k-1} \uvec{u}

					\amp + b_{m-k} \uvec{v}' + b_{m-k+1} A \uvec{v}' + \dotsb + b_{m-1} A^{k-1} \uvec{v}
					= \zerovec
				</mrow>
			</md>,
			and from here we can repeat the argument of the <m>m=k</m> case.
		</p></case>

		<case><title>Case <m>m \lt k</m></title><p>
			Argue exactly as in the <m>m \gt k</m> case with the roles of <m>m</m> and <m>k</m> reversed.

	</proof>

</proposition>

<p>
As a corollary,
we can justify our method for choosing new generating vectors at each step of
<xref ref="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc1" />.
</p>

<corollary>

	<statement><p>
		Suppose <m>\uvec{w}_1, \uvec{w}_2, \dotsc, \uvec{w}_\ell</m>
		are vectors from the null space of <m>A^m</m> such that
		<me> \Span \{ \uvec{w}_1, \uvec{w}_2, \dotsc, \uvec{w}_\ell \} </me>
		and the null space of <m>A^{m-1}</m> form a pair of independent subspaces.
		Then the <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces generated by these vectors also form a collection of independent subspaces.
	</p></statement>

	<proof>

		<p>
		Write <m>W_j</m> to represent the <m>A</m>-cyclic space generated by <m>\uvec{w}_j</m>.
		By our assumption, no individual vector <m>\uvec{w}_j</m> from our collection can lie in the null space of <m>A^{m-1}</m>
		(<xref ref="theorem-block-diag-pair-indep-subsp-iff-zero-intersect" />).
		In that case,
		<xref ref="theorem-elem-nilpotent-cyclic-basis-terminating-in-zero" /> tells us that
		<me> \{ \uvec{w}_j, A \uvec{w}_j, A^2 \uvec{w}_j, \dotsc, A^{m-1} \uvec{w}_j \} </me>
		is a (cyclic) basis for <m>W_j</m>,
		and all of these spaces have the same dimension.
		</p>

		<p>
		Since each <m>\uvec{w}_j</m> is in the null space of <m>A^m</m>,
		each final cyclic basis vector <m>A^{m-1} \uvec{w}_j</m> is in the null space of <m>A</m>.
		Therefore, <xref ref="proposition-triang-nilpotent-indep-cyclic-with-last-vector-null" /> applies,
		and to demonstrate that the <m>W_j</m> form an independent collection of subspaces we just need to demonstrate that the collection
		<me> \{ A^{m-1} \uvec{w}_1, A^{m-1} \uvec{w}_2, \dotsc, A^{m-1} \uvec{w}_\ell \} </me>
		of final vectors is linearly independent.
		</p>

		<p>
		So set up the <xref ref="procedure-linear-indep-concepts-test-for-dep-indep" text="title" />:
		<me> c_1 A^{m-1} \uvec{w}_1 + c_2 A^{m-1} \uvec{w}_2 + \dotsb c_\ell A^{m-1} \uvec{w}_\ell = \zerovec </me>.
		Factoring out the common <m>A^{m-1}</m> gives us
		<me> A^{m-1} (c_1 \uvec{w}_1 + c_2 \uvec{w}_2 + \dotsb c_\ell \uvec{w}_\ell) = \zerovec </me>,
		which gives us a linear combination of the <m>\uvec{w}_j</m> in the null space of <m>A^{m-1}</m>.
		By assumption, this linear combination must be the trivial one,
		so that each coefficient <m>c_j</m> is equal to <m>0</m>.
		</p>

	</proof>

</corollary>

<p>
The assumption of the corollary is precisely the situation at each step of
<xref ref="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc1" />.
If <m>\{\uvec{u}_1, \uvec{u}_2, \dotsc, \uvec{u}_s \}</m> is a basis for the null space of <m>A^{m-1}</m>
and we extend that to a basis
<me> \{\uvec{u}_1, \uvec{u}_2, \dotsc, \uvec{u}_s, \uvec{w}_1, \uvec{w}_2, \dotsc, \uvec{w}_\ell \} </me>
for the null space of <m>A^m</m>,
then no non-trivial linear combination of the new <m>\uvec{w}_j</m> vectors can be in the null space of <m>A^{m-1}</m>,
as such a combination would have to also be equal to a linear combination of the <m>\uvec{u}_j</m> vectors,
violating the linear independence of the full collection.
</p>

<p>
However, notice that it was not necessary to explicitly assume that the <m>\uvec{w}_j</m> in the corollary are linearly independent.
Since the zero vector is in the null space of <m>A^{m-1}</m>,
then the stated assumption in the corollary implies that no non-trivial linear combination of the <m>\uvec{w}_j</m> can equal to <m>\zerovec</m>.
</p>
