<title>Determining the form indirectly</title>

<p>
Here we will carry out the indirect analysis method described in
<xref ref="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-indirect" />
for a matrix <m>A</m> that is similar to a triangular-block nilpotent form matrix <m>N</m> as in
<xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-rank-info" />.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-triang-nilpotent-indirect">

	<p>
	Suppose <m>A</m> is an <m>19 \times 19</m> matrix that is similar to the triangular-block nilpotent matrix
	<me> N = \begin{bmatrix} N_1 \\ \amp N_2 \\ \amp\amp N_3 \\ \amp\amp\amp N_4 \\ \amp\amp\amp\amp N_5 \\ \amp\amp\amp\amp\amp N_6 \end{bmatrix} </me>,
	where the elementary nilpotent blocks <m>N_1</m> and <m>N_2</m> are each <m>5 \times 5</m>,
	blocks <m>N_3</m> and <m>N_4</m> are each <m>3 \times 3</m>,
	block <m>N_5</m> is <m>2 \times 2</m>,
	and block <m>N_6</m> is <m>1 \times 1</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	We will carry out our analysis as if we don't actually know the form matrix <m>N</m>,
	but at the same time we will use our <q>secret</q> knowledge of <m>N</m> to <q>know</q> the required properties of <m>A</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	We should first compute the powers of <m>A</m> to determine the degree of nilpotency.
	We should find <m>A^5 = \zerovec</m> while <m>A^4 \neq \zerovec</m>.
	If we didn't already know the form <m>N</m>,
	this computation would tell us that the largest block in <m>N</m> is size <m>5 \times 5</m>,
	because any larger block would not yet be zero at the <m>\nth[5]</m> power,
	and smaller blocks become zero before the <m>\nth[5]</m> power.
	After this we should compute <m>\rank A^4</m>,
	which in this case we would find to be <m>2</m>.
	When we back off the exponent by one like this,
	blocks that are smaller than <m>4 \times 4</m> will still all be taken to zero blocks,
	but a single <m>1</m> in the bottom left corner of each of the <m>5 \times 5</m> blocks will have reappeared.
	So <m>\rank A^4 = 2</m> tells us that we have two such <q>corner ones</q> in <m>N^4</m>,
	one in each of two blocks of size <m>5 \times 5</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	We continue with rank computations of lower powers.
	Backing off the exponent by one again,
	in this case we should find <m>\rank A^3 = 4</m>.
	Our expectation is that in <m>N^3</m>,
	each of the two (now known) <m>5 \times 5</m> blocks would have grown in rank from <m>1</m> to <m>2</m> as they each <q>re-grow</q> a subdiagonal of two <m>1</m>s in the lower left,
	for a total rank contribution of <m>4</m> from these two blocks.
	Since that is our total rank for <m>A^3</m>,
	this tells us that there are no blocks of size <m>4 \times 4</m>,
	since if there were they would have <q>reappeared</q> at the <m>\ird</m> power with a <q>corner one</q> in the lower left of each,
	causing a larger jump in rank than expected.
	</p>

	<p>
	However, calculating <m>\rank A^2</m> should yield <m>8</m> in this case,
	a larger rank than expected.
	The two <m>5 \times 5</m> blocks in <m>N</m> each gain one in rank,
	as their subdiagonals of <m>1</m>s march higher up from the lower left toward the main diagonal.
	So their total contribution to the rank increases from <m>4</m> to <m>6</m> as we move from <m>A^3</m> to <m>A^2</m>.
	Since the calculated rank is <m>2</m> larger than the expected rank of <m>6</m> from our two known <m>5 \times 5</m> blocks,
	we conclude that two new blocks have reappeared with a solitary <m>1</m> in their respective lower-left corners.
	Since these blocks reappeared at the second power,
	they must have size <m>3 \times 3</m>.
	So now we know about two <m>5 \times 5</m> blocks and two <m>3 \times 3</m> blocks.
	</p>

	<p>
	Finally, with four known blocks,
	we would expect the rank to increase from <m>8</m> to <m>12</m> as we move from <m>A^2</m> to <m>A^1</m>,
	an increase by <m>1</m> for each known block.
	But a calculation should reveal <m>\rank A = 13</m>,
	which means that one new block has reappeared.
	And since it appeared at exponent one,
	it must have size <m>2 \times 2</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	From above, we have <m>\rank A = 13</m>, so
	<me>\nullity A = 19 - 13 = 6</me>.
	This means that <m>N</m> should have six blocks (which we secretly know it does).
	And since we already have five blocks
	(two <m>5 \times 5</m> blocks, two <m>3 \times 3</m> blocks, and one <m>2 \times 2</m> block),
	this means that there must be one remaining unknown block.
	It can't be size <m>2 \times 2</m>,
	as the <m>\rank A^1</m> calculation should have revealed all of the blocks of that size.
	So there must be one remaining <m>1 \times 1</m> block,
	and we now have enough information to know the form matrix <m>N</m> precisely.
	</p>

</example>

<remark><p>
	At <m>\rank A</m>, there is no further backwards one can go.
	A <m>1 \times 1</m> elementary nilpotent block is just a <m>1 \times 1</m> zero matrix,
	and makes no contribution to the rank at any exponent.
	So if our number of blocks hasn't reached <m>\nullity A</m>
	and we haven't yet filled out the full size of the matrix at the end of the analysis
	(as in the previous example),
	we would conclude that the rest of the form matrix is filled out by <m>1 \times 1</m> zero blocks.
</p></remark>

<title>Determining a transition matrix</title>

<p>
Here are two examples of determining a transition matrix <m>P</m> that will put a nilpotent matrix <m>A</m> into triangular-block nilpotent form.
In the first we will carrying out <xref ref="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc1" />.
We use the matrix that you explored in
both <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-form-from-info" />
and <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-transition-proc" />.

	To carry out <xref ref="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc1" />,
	we first need to determine the degree of nilpotency of <m>A</m>.
	In <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-form-from-info" />,
	we found this degree to be <m>k = 4</m>.
	So the largest block(s) in the triangular-block nilpotent form for <m>A</m> will have size <m>4</m>,
	and we need to look for the corresponding <m>4</m>-dimensional <m>A</m>-cyclic subspaces of <m>\R^9</m>.

		This null space has dimension <m>7</m>,

		So we again need to extend by a single vector.
		However, we don't want to have any overlap with the <m>4</m>-dimensional cyclic space we've already obtained,
		so before we look for <q>new</q> vectors we should extend by old vectors.
		The <q>second</q> vector <m>A \uvec{e}_1</m> from the previous step is in the null space of <m>A^3</m> but not in the null space of <m>A^2</m>.
		This means that <m>A \uvec{e}_1</m> would generate a <m>3</m>-dimensional cyclic space,
		but it would not be independent from what we already have.
		On the other hand, including <m>A \uvec{e}_1</m> with our basis above gets us up to dimension <m>8</m>,
		so there is no further to go and no new independent vectors from the null space of <m>A^3</m> can be obtained.
		</p>

		<p>
		We conclude that there are no blocks of size <m>3</m> in the triangular-block nilpotent form for <m>A</m>,

		As our first generator <m>\uvec{e}_1</m> was chosen from the null space of <m>A^4</m>,
		the vector <m>A^2 \uvec{e}_1</m> will be in the null space of <m>A^2</m>.

		We also already have a basis for the null space of <m>A^2</m> from our previous step,
		so it is just a matter of trial-and-error to choose two of those old basis vectors to include with our five current basis vectors,
		with the criteria being independence with our five vectors.
		By inspection, we choose
		<md>
			<mrow> \uvec{u} = (  1 ,  0 ,  0 , 0 , 5 , 0 , 0 , 0 ,  0 ), </mrow>
			<mrow> \uvec{v} = ( -1 ,  0 ,  0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 2 , 0 ,  0 ), </mrow>

		and with our CAS we confirm that all seven vectors together are linearly independent.

			\amp
			W_3 \amp = \Span \{ \uvec{v}, A \uvec{u} \},

	We don't have any dimension <m>1</m> cyclic spaces, so let's move on to considering the collection of final vectors from each basis:
	<me> \{ A^2\uvec{e}_1, A^2\uvec{e}_2, A^2\uvec{e}_3, A\uvec{e}_4, A^2\uvec{e}_5 \}. </me>
	Examining the columns of <m>A^2</m>,
	notice that the first three vectors are all equal to each other,
	and the fifth vector is the negative of the those first three.
	Let's begin with the dependence relation
	<me> A^2\uvec{e}_1 - A^2\uvec{e}_2 = \zerovec </me>.
	Factoring out the <m>A^2</m>, this turns into
	<me> A^2(\uvec{e}_1 - \uvec{e}_2) = \zerovec. </me>
	</p>
	<aside><title>Careful</title><p>
		It is <em>not</em> correct to just <q>cancel</q> off the <m>A^2</m>, since <m>A^2</m> is not invertible.
	</p></aside>
	<p>
	We form the new cyclic space generated by <m>\uvec{f}_1 = \uvec{e}_1 - \uvec{e}_2</m>,
	and call it <m>U_1</m>.
	The above relation says that <m>A^2 \uvec{f}_1 = \zerovec</m>, so we have
	<me> U_1 = \Span \{ \uvec{f}_1, A \uvec{f}_1 \} </me>.
	Our dependence relation involved the final vectors from <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m>.
	These two spaces have equal dimension,
	so we can use the new space <m>U_1</m> to replace either of <m>W_1</m> or <m>W_2</m>.
	If we decide to replace <m>W_1</m>, our new collection of cyclic subspaces is

	Since <m>A</m> does not have maximum degree of nilpotency,
	we know it is not similar to an elementary nilpotent form matrix.
	In other words, it is not possible for us to reduce down to a single <m>A</m>-invariant space,
	and the fact that <m>A \uvec{e}_4</m> and <m>A^2 \uvec{e}_5</m> are independent confirm that we are finished at this point.
	All that is left is to form the transition matrix

	</me>,
	where we have ordered the bases for our <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces in the columns of <m>P</m> according to their dimensions to ensure that the elementary nilpotent blocks appear in order of decreasing size in the form matrix <m>\inv{P} A P</m>:
	<me>

<remark><p>  <!-- old label: \label{REM::nilp.triang.compute.form.no.inv.P} -->
	Once again, in either example of this subsection,
	it is not necessary to compute <m>\inv{P}</m> to know the form of <m>\inv{P}A P </m>.
	We know that each block is elementary nilpotent,
	and the number and sizes of the blocks is determined by the number and dimensions of the obtained <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces.
