<subsection xml:id="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-elem-to-block">
<title>From elementary to block nilpotent form</title>

<p>
Just as scalar-triangular form is the single-block case of triangular block form,
elementary nilpotent form is the single-block case of a multi-block nilpotent form that we will call
<term>triangular-block nilpotent form</term>.
Elementary nilpotent form can be achieved when the nilpotent matrix has maximum degree of nilpotency.
If the degree of nilpotency is less than maximum,
then the matrix must be <q>built</q> out of smaller elementary nilpotent blocks that become zero earlier.
</p><p>
Justifying the theory behind the pattern of similarity for triangular-block nilpotent form is beyond the scope of this book,
but we can recognize the pattern by combining the patterns for block-diagonal form and elementary nilpotent form.
A matrix is similar to one in block diagonal form when there exists a complete set of independent, invariant subspaces of <m>\R^n</m> (or <m>\C^n</m>, as appropriate).
Each of those blocks will be in elementary nilpotent form when the corresponding subspace is cyclic with a spanning set that terminates in the zero vector,
<ie /> the last vector in each cyclic basis for the independent subspaces must be in the null space of the matrix.
Since cyclic spaces are always invariant
(<xref ref="proposition-elem-nilpotent-cyclic-is-invariant" />),
we can instead say that <alert>we need a complete set of independent, cyclic subspaces with each cyclic basis terminating in the null space of the matrix</alert>.
</p><p>
We can be even a little more specific.
We need a cyclic basis for each of these subspaces,
but we also need the collection of subspaces to be independent.
By definition, this means that we need the collection of cyclic bases to be independent when taken all together.
In particular, the collection of final null space vectors from each cyclic basis must be independent when taken all together.
</p>

<convention xml:id="pattern-elem-nilpotent-concepts-similarity">
	<title>Similarity with a triangular-block nilpotent matrix</title>
	<p>
	For <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> to be similar to a triangular-block nilpotent matrix <m>N</m> via similarity relation <m>\inv{P} A P</m>,
	the columns of the transition matrix <m>P</m> must form a collection of cyclic bases for a complete set of independent, <m>A</m>-cyclic subspaces of <m>\R^n</m> (or <m>\C^n</m>, as appropriate).
	</p><p>
	Furthermore, if the final vector is removed from each of these <m>A</m>-cyclic bases,
	this collection of final vectors must be a linearly independent subset of the null space of <m>A</m>.
	</p>
</convention>

<p>
We will learn that the condition on the final null space vectors in this procedure actually guarantees that the collection of <em>subspaces</em> will be independent
(<xref ref="proposition-triang-nilpotent-indep-cyclic-with-last-vector-null" />),
which reduces the conditions to be checked even further.

<subsection xml:id="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-indirect">
<title>Determining the form indirectly</title>

<p>
In <xref ref="subsection-elem-nilpotent-concepts-props" />,
we listed two important properties of elementary nilpotent form:
<ul>
	<li> powers of elementary nilpotent form only become zero at the size of the matrix; and </li>
	<li>
		the ranks of powers of elementary nilpotent form decrease by one for each increase in exponent,
		beginning at rank <m>n - 1</m> at exponent <m>1</m> and ending at rank <m>0</m> at exponent <m>n</m>.
	</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Each block in a triangular-block nilpotent matrix will exhibit the same properties,
and each of these properties is preserved by similarity.
So for a given nilpotent matrix <m>A</m>,
we can determine exactly what form of triangular-block nilpotent matrix that <m>A</m> is similar to simply by considering the
<xref ref="definition-elem-nilpotent-degree-nilpotency" text="title" /> of <m>A</m>
and the ranks of its powers.
</p><p>
In <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-rank-info" />,
we carried out this task for a specific form of triangular-block form matrix,
but then used our observations to imagine how we could reverse-engineer the form matrix.
</p>

<paragraphs><title>The number of elementary blocks</title><p>
Suppose that <m>A</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> nilpotent matrix,
and is similar to triangular-block form matrix <m>N</m>.
Our first observation in
<xref ref="subsection-elem-nilpotent-concepts-props" />
was that the nullity of <m>A</m> tells us the number of blocks in <m>N</m>.
The identity matrix with its diagonal of ones down the <em>main</em> diagonal has full rank <m>n</m>.
If <m>N</m> were actually in elementary nilpotent form,
effectively consisting of one large elementary block with a line of ones down the first <em>sub</em>-diagonal,
then <m>\rank N</m> would be one less than full at <m>n - 1</m>.
If <m>N</m> instead contains <m>\ell</m> blocks,
then <em>each</em> of those blocks is deficient from full rank by one,
and so <m>\rank N</m> would be <m>n - \ell</m>.
<xref ref="theorem-col-row-null-space-rank-nullity" text="title" />
tells us that rank and nullity add up to the size of the matrix,
so the nullity must be <m>\ell</m>.
And since similar <m>A</m> and <m>N</m> share the same nullity,
<alert>the nullity of <m>A</m> tells the number of elementary nilpotent blocks in <m>N</m></alert>.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>The size of the largest block</title><p>
We may compute powers of a block diagonal matrix by just computing powers of the blocks.
And we know that powers of an elementary nilpotent block in <m>N</m> won't become zero until the size of the block.
Since the smaller blocks become zero at smaller exponents,
<m>N</m> itself will become zero precisely when its largest blocks do.
And since similar <m>A</m> and <m>N</m> share degree of nilpotency
(<xref ref="proposition-cayley-hamilton-similar-to-nilpotent" />),
we can say that
<alert>the degree of nilpotency of <m>A</m> determines the size of the largest block in <m>N</m></alert>.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>The number of blocks of largest size</title><p>
It is certainly possible for <m>N</m> to have multiple blocks of the same size.
Now that we know how to determine the size of the largest block,
we can ask: how many blocks of that size does <m>N</m> have?
Suppose the largest size of block in <m>N</m> is <m>k \times k</m>.
Then from our discussion above, we will see <m>N^k = \zerovec</m> but <m>N^{k-1} \neq \zerovec</m>.
In <m>N^{k - 1}</m>, all blocks of size smaller than <m>k</m> have still been taken to zero by the exponent <m>k - 1</m>.
What will appear in the powers blocks of largest size to make <m>N^{k - 1} \neq \zerovec</m> true?
Backing the exponent off by one from the degree of nilpotency of the largest blocks will cause a single one to appear in the lower left entry of each block of largest size.
We can use these solitary ones to count the blocks of largest size,
but again transfer the property by which we will count them from <m>N</m> to <m>A</m> via similarity:
<alert>if <m>k</m> is the size of the largest blocks in <m>N</m>, then <m>\rank A</m> tells the number of these blocks of largest size</alert>.
</p></paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>The number and sizes of smaller blocks</title>
<p>
We can continue the reasoning in our analysis of the blocks of largest size.
And just as in that analysis,
we can think in terms of the blocks of <m>N</m> but compute in terms of <m>A</m>
Again let <m>k</m> represent the size of the largest block in <m>N</m>,
and let <m>m</m> represent the number of these blocks.
We then have <m>\rank A^k = 0</m> and <m>\rank AN^{k - 1} = m</m>.
If we back the exponent off one more to <m>A^{k - 2}</m>,
the line of sub-diagonal ones in <m>N</m> will start reappearing in each block of size <m>k</m>,
and we expect the rank to increase by one in each of those blocks.
And this continues with every step that we decrease the exponent.
That is, we expect
<me> \rank N^{k - 2} = 2m, \quad \rank N^{k-3} = 3m, \quad \rank N^{k-4} = 4m, \dotsc </me>.
However, this pattern will be broken as soon as the block of next largest size <q>reappears</q> with a solitary one in its lower left corner.
So if <m>\rank N^{k-j}</m> is larger than the pattern above predicts,
we must have a new block of smaller size reappearing.
Since boosting the exponent back up to <m>k - j + 1</m> would make that block disappear again,
that exponent value must be the size of that next largest block.
And since we will get a new solitary corner one in <m>N^{k-j}</m> in each block,
the <em>amount</em> that <m>\rank N^{k-j}</m> is larger than the pattern above predicts tells the number of blocks of that size.
</p><p>
From here, we can make a new <q>expected</q> pattern of rank increases in <m>A</m> based on the sizes and numbers of blocks in <m>N</m> that we already know about,
and any new jump in rank to a value larger than the pattern predicts tells the existence, size, and number of occurrences of new blocks in <m>N</m>.

<subsection xml:id="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-proc">
<title>Procedure for any nilpotent matrix</title>

<p>
For the sake of completeness,
here is a procedure that will put any nilpotent matrix into triangular-block nilpotent form.
It is a very inefficient algorithm,
but at least it is directly comprehensible (with some effort) from the theory developed in this chapter.
</p>

<algorithm xml:id="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc">
	<title>Procedure to put a <em>nilpotent</em> <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> into triangular-block nilpotent form</title>
	<p><ol>
		<li> Determine an <m>A</m>-cyclic basis for each of the <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces generated by standard basis vectors. </li>
		<li>
			Check each cyclic space of dimension <m>1</m> in this collection:
			if the generating vector is in the span of the collection of final vectors taken from each of the other cyclic bases,
			discard that cyclic space.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the set of final vectors taken from each remaining cyclic basis is linearly independent, stop.
			You can now form the matrix <m>P</m> by ordering your cyclic spaces by dimension (largest to smallest),
			and using the cyclic bases as the columns of <m>P</m>.
			Otherwise, go on to the next step.
		</li>
		<li>
			Determine a linear dependence relation amongst the final vectors taken from each cyclic basis.
			Factor out the largest power of <m>A</m> possible from this relation.
			Use the vector left behind (after factoring out the power of <m>A</m>) to generate a new <m>A</m>-cyclic space.
			Use this new space to replace one of your old spaces:
			in particular, it should replace a space whose final vector was involved in the determined dependence relation,
			and whose dimension was smallest amongst such spaces.
		</li>
		<li> Repeat the steps above for the new, refined collection of <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces, beginning at the second step. </li>
	</ol></p>
</algorithm>

<remark><p>
	Unless <m>A</m> is the zero matrix, there is no way the collection of <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces generated by the standard basis vectors obtained in the first step can be independent,
	because the dimensions of these spaces will add up to more than <m>n</m>.
	The point of the procedure is to take this collection as a starting point,
	and reduce it down to an independent collection by discarding dependent spaces,
	just as we might reduce a dependent spanning set down to a basis for a space by discarding dependent vectors.
	The main criteria for deciding which spaces to discard is dependence of the final null space vectors in each <m>A</m>-cyclic basis,
	as well as a preference for larger <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces over smaller ones.
