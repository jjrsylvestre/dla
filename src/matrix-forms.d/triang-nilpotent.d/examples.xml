<title>Determining the form indirectly</title>

<p>
Here we will carry out the indirect analysis method described in
<xref ref="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-indirect" />
for a matrix <m>A</m> that is similar to a triangular-block nilpotent form matrix <m>N</m> as in
<xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-rank-info" />.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-triang-nilpotent-indirect">
	<p>
	Suppose <m>A</m> is an <m>18 \times 18</m> matrix that is similar to the triangular-block nilpotent matrix
	<me> N = \begin{bmatrix} N_1 \\ \amp N_2 \\ \amp\amp N_3 \\ \amp\amp\amp N_4 \\ \amp\amp\amp\amp N_5 \end{bmatrix} </me>,
	where the elementary nilpotent blocks <m>N_1</m> and <m>N_2</m> are each <m>5 \times 5</m>,
	blocks <m>N_3</m> and <m>N_4</m> are each <m>3 \times 3</m>,
	and block <m>N_5</m> is <m>2 \times 2</m>.
	</p><p>
	We will carry out our analysis as if we don't actually know the form matrix <m>N</m>,
	but at the same time we will use our <q>secret</q> knowledge of <m>N</m> to <q>know</q> the required properties of <m>A</m>.
	</p><p>
	We should first compute the powers of <m>A</m> to determine the degree of nilpotency.
	For this matrix, we should find <m>A^5 = \zerovec</m> while <m>A^4 \neq \zerovec</m>.
	This would tells us that the largest block in <m>N</m> is size <m>5 \times 5</m>
	(which we know it is).
	After this we should compute <m>\rank A^4</m>,
	and in this case we should find it to be <m>2</m>,
	which would tells us that there are two blocks of size <m>5 \times 5</m>.
	</p><p>
	After determining the size and number of blocks of largest size,
	we would continue with rank computations of lower power.
	For this matrix,
	we would calculate <m>\rank A^3 = 4</m>.
	Since we already know there are two blocks of size <m>5 \times 5</m>,
	and each of these blocks should increase in rank by one from <m>A^4</m> to <m>A^3</m>,
	we would expect <m>\rank A^3 = 4</m>,
	which tells us that there are no blocks of size <m>4 \times 4</m>.
	</p><p>
	However, calculating <m>\rank A^2 = 8</m> yields a rank larger than expected.
	The two <m>5 \times 5</m> blocks should only increase the rank from <m>4</m> to <m>6</m> as we move from <m>A^3</m> to <m>A^2</m>,
	but the calculated rank is <m>2</m> larger than expected.
	This means that two new blocks have appeared,
	and since they appeared at the second power, they must have size <m>3 \times 3</m>.
	So know we know about two <m>5 \times 5</m> blocks and two <m>3 \times 3</m> blocks.
	</p><p>
	Finally, with four known blocks, we would expect the rank to increase from <m>8</m> to <m>12</m> as we move from <m>A^2</m> to <m>A^1</m>.
	But a calculation should reveal <m>\rank A = 13</m>,
	which means that one new block has appeared.
	And since it appeared at exponent one,
	it must have size <m>2 \times 2</m>.
	</p><p>
	From above, we have <m>\rank A = 13</m>, so
	<me>\nullity A = 18 - 13 = 5</me>.
	This means that <m>N</m> should have five blocks (which we know it does).
	And since we already have <m>5</m> blocks
	(two <m>5 \times 5</m> blocks, two <m>3 \times 3</m> blocks, and one <m>2 \times 2</m> block),
	we have enough information to know the form matrix <m>N</m> precisely.
	</p>
</example>

<remark><p>
	At <m>\rank A</m>, there is no further backwards one can go.
	But what if our number of blocks hasn't reached <m>\nullity A</m>?
	A <m>1 \times 1</m> elementary nilpotent block is just a <m>1 \times 1</m> zero matrix,
	and makes no contribution to the rank at any exponent.
	So if we haven't yet filled out the full size of the matrix at the end of the analysis,
	we would conclude that the rest of the form matrix is filled out by <m>1 \times 1</m> zero blocks.

<title>Determining a transition matrix</title>

<p>
Here are two examples of determining a transition matrix <m>P</m> that will put a nilpotent matrix <m>A</m> into triangular-block nilpotent form.
In the first we will carrying out <xref ref="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc" />,
but in the second we will use a different strategy.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-triang-nilpotent-proc-5x5">
	<title>A <m>5 \times 5</m> example</title>
	<p>
	Consider the <m>5 \times 5</m> matrix
	<md><mrow>
		A = \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
			 1 \amp -2 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp  0 \\
			-1 \amp -2 \amp -2 \amp  0 \amp  1 \\
			 0 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\
			 3 \amp  1 \amp  2 \amp -1 \amp -2 \\
			 0 \amp -3 \amp -2 \amp -1 \amp  1
		\end{array}\right]
	</mrow></md>.
	Compute the powers of <m>A</m>:
	<md><mrow>
		A^2 \amp= \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
			 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp 0 \amp  0 \\
			 1 \amp  1 \amp  1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \\
			-1 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp  1 \\

			 0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \amp 0 \amp  0

		\amp
		A^3 \amp= \zerovec
	</mrow></md>.
	So <m>A</m> is nilpotent of degree <m>3</m>.
	</p><p>
	The standard basis for <m>\R^5</m> has five vectors in it,
	so we begin with five <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces:
	<md alignment="gather">
		<mrow>
			W_1 = \Span \{ \uvec{e}_1, A\uvec{e}_1, A^2\uvec{e}_1, \dotsc \}, \quad
			W_2 = \Span \{ \uvec{e}_2, A\uvec{e}_2, A^2\uvec{e}_2, \dotsc \},
		</mrow><mrow>
			W_3 = \Span \{ \uvec{e}_3, A\uvec{e}_3, A^2\uvec{e}_3, \dotsc \}, \quad

			W_5 = \Span \{ \uvec{e}_5, A\uvec{e}_5, A^2\uvec{e}_5, \dotsc \}.
		</mrow>
	</md>
	But recall that for any matrix <m>B</m>,
	the product <m>B \uvec{e}_j</m> is precisely the <m>\nth[j]</m> column of <m>B</m>.
	So, by examining when the columns of powers of <m>A</m> first become zero,
	we see we can reduce the cyclic spanning sets for each of these spaces:
	<md alignment="gather">
		<mrow>
			W_1 = \Span \{ \uvec{e}_1, A\uvec{e}_1, A^2\uvec{e}_1 \}, \quad
			W_2 = \Span \{ \uvec{e}_2, A\uvec{e}_2, A^2\uvec{e}_2 \},

			W_5 = \Span \{ \uvec{e}_5, A\uvec{e}_5, A^2\uvec{e}_5 \}.
		</mrow>
	</md>
	</p><p>
	We don't have any dimension <m>1</m> cyclic spaces, so let's move on to considering the collection of final vectors from each basis:
	<me> \{ A^2\uvec{e}_1, A^2\uvec{e}_2, A^2\uvec{e}_3, A\uvec{e}_4, A^2\uvec{e}_5 \}. </me>
	Examining the columns of <m>A^2</m>,
	notice that the first three vectors are all equal to each other,
	and the fifth vector is the negative of the those first three.
	Let's begin with the dependence relation
	<me> A^2\uvec{e}_1 - A^2\uvec{e}_2 = \zerovec </me>.
	Factoring out the <m>A^2</m>, this turns into
	<me> A^2(\uvec{e}_1 - \uvec{e}_2) = \zerovec. </me>
	</p>
	<aside><title>Careful</title><p>
		It is <em>not</em> correct to just <q>cancel</q> off the <m>A^2</m>, since <m>A^2</m> is not invertible.
	</p></aside>
	<p>
	We form the new cyclic space generated by <m>\uvec{f}_1 = \uvec{e}_1 - \uvec{e}_2</m>,
	and call it <m>U_1</m>.
	The above relation says that <m>A^2 \uvec{f}_1 = \zerovec</m>, so we have
	<me> U_1 = \Span \{ \uvec{f}_1, A \uvec{f}_1 \} </me>.
	Our dependence relation involved the final vectors from <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m>.
	These two spaces have equal dimension,
	so we can use the new space <m>U_1</m> to replace either of <m>W_1</m> or <m>W_2</m>.
	If we decide to replace <m>W_1</m>, our new collection of cyclic subspaces is
	<md alignment="gather">
		<mrow>
			U_1 = \Span \{ \uvec{f}_1, A\uvec{f}_1 \}, \quad

	Since <m>A</m> does not have maximum degree of nilpotency,

	In other words, it is not possible for us to reduce down to a single <m>A</m>-invariant space,
	and the fact that <m>A \uvec{e}_4</m> and <m>A^2 \uvec{e}_5</m> are independent confirm that we are finished at this point.

	With such a large matrix,
	<xref ref="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc" /> would take quite a while.
	Instead, we'll try arrive at the transition matrix <m>P</m> a bit faster by using the observation that the final vectors in each of a complete set of independent, cyclic bases for nilpotent <m>A</m> must form a linearly independent set in the null space of <m>A</m>.
	</p><p>
	But first, let's use the patterns of <xref ref="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-indirect" /> to determine the number and sizes of the blocks in the triangular-block nilpotent form for <m>A</m>,
	as this will tell us the number and dimensions of <m>A</m>-cyclic spaces that we need.
	Ask your favourite computer algebra system (CAS) to compute the powers of <m>A</m>.
	This will confirm that <m>A</m> is nilpotent,
	with degree of nilpotency <m>4</m>.
	This tells us that the largest block in the nilpotent triangular form for <m>A</m> should have size <m>4 \times 4</m>.
	Now ask your CAS to compute <m>\rank A</m> <mdash />
	it should return the answer <m>5</m>.
	Therefore, <m>\nullity A = 9 - 5 = 4</m>,
	so we are looking for four blocks in total.
	Next, have your CAS tell you that <m>\rank(A^3) = 1</m>,
	and conclude that there is only a single block of size <m>4 \times 4</m>.
	Computing <m>\rank (A^2) = 2</m> and combining it with the previously calculated <m>\rank A = 5</m>,
	we can conclude that there are also two <m>2 \times 2</m> blocks.
	But as this is only three of the four blocks accounted for,
	we must also have a final <m>1 \times 1</m> zero block.
	So we now know exactly what we're looking for:
	four independent, cyclic subspaces of dimensions <m>4,2,2,1</m>.
	</p><p>
	The first column of <m>A^3</m> is nonzero and lies in the null space of <m>A</m> (since <m>A^4 = \zerovec</m>),
	so we can get our desired four-dimensional cyclic subspace by taking
	<me> W_1 = \Span \{ \uvec{e}_1, A\uvec{e}_1, A^2 \uvec{e}_1, A^3 \uvec{e}_1 \}. </me>
	</p><p>
	We could try to use a similar approach to get a dimension <m>2</m> cyclic space by examining the zero columns in <m>A^2</m>,
	but unfortunately there are none.
	So let's attack more directly using the null space of <m>A</m>,
	since we will need the final vectors from each of our cyclic bases to form an independent set in this null space.
	</p><p>
	Ask your CAS to put <m>A</m> into RREF.
	From <m>\RREF(A)</m>,
	we find the null space of <m>A</m> to be
	<me>
		\Span \left\{
			\left[ \begin{array}{r} 0 \\  1 \\  0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\  0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
			\left[ \begin{array}{r} 2 \\  0 \\ -2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right],
			\left[ \begin{array}{r} 0 \\  5 \\  0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\  0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
			\left[ \begin{array}{r} 0 \\ -2 \\  0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\  0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
		\right\}.
	</me>
	Write <m>\uvec{n}_1,\uvec{n}_2,\uvec{n}_3,\uvec{n}_4</m> for these four null space basis vectors above.
	Now, <m>\uvec{n}_1</m> lies in <m>W_1</m> (it's a scalar multiple of <m>A^3 \uvec{e}_1</m>),
	so let's move on to considering <m>\uvec{n}_2</m>.
	Since <m>A\uvec{n}_2 = \zerovec</m>,
	the vector <m>\uvec{n}_2</m> generates a one-dimensional cyclic space.
	Could we enlarge it to a two-dimensional cyclic space?
	This would entail going <em>backwards</em> in the cyclic spanning set sequence
	<me> \{ \uvec{v}, A \uvec{v}, A^2 \uvec{v}, \dotsc \} </me>,
	where each vector is <m>A</m> times the previous one.
	We already have the last-before-<m>\zerovec</m> in this sequence as <m>\uvec{n}_2</m>.
	So, we would like to determine a vector <m>\uvec{n}_2'</m> such that <m>A\uvec{n}_2' = \uvec{n}_2</m>.
	This is equivalent to trying to find a solution to the system
	<me> \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A \amp \uvec{n}_2 \end{array}\right] </me>.
	Ask your CAS to put the augmented matrix above into RREF <mdash />
	you will discover that this system is inconsistent.
	This is not a failure though,
	because we know we need a one-dimensional cyclic space that is independent from <m>W_1</m>,
	and the space
	<me> W_4 = \Span \{ \uvec{n}_2 \} </me>
	fits the bill.
	</p>
	<aside><title>Note</title><p>
		We have labelled this one-dimensional space as <m>W_4</m> instead of <m>W_2</m> because we know we want four cyclic spaces ordered from largest to smallest,
		and the one-dimensional space will have to be the smallest.
	</p></aside>
	<p>
	Let's try the same idea for <m>\uvec{n}_3</m>.
	Since <m>A\uvec{n}_3 = \zerovec</m>,
	the vector <m>\uvec{n}_3</m> generates a one-dimensional cyclic space.
	Could we enlarge this space by finding <m>\uvec{n}_3'</m> such that <m>A\uvec{n}_3' = \uvec{n}_3</m>?
	To do this, try to solve the system
	<me> \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A \amp \uvec{n}_3 \end{array}\right] </me>.
	This time the system has solutions,
	and a particular solution is <me> \uvec{n}_3' = (-5, 0, 10, 0, -5, 0, 6, 0, 0) </me>.
	Using this vector we can form a two-dimensional cyclic space
	<me> W_2 = \Span \{\uvec{n}_3', A\uvec{n}_3' \} </me>,
	where <m>A\uvec{n}_3'=\uvec{n}_3</m>.
	</p>
	<aside><title>Note</title><p>
		If we hadn't pre-determined the number and dimensions of the required cyclic spaces,
		we might be tempted to try to enlarge this space even further by going backwards another step.
		But system
		<me> \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A \amp \uvec{n}_3' \end{array}\right] </me>
		is inconsistent anyway.
	</p></aside>
	<p>
	We just need one more two-dimensional cyclic space.
	Let's work with <m>\uvec{n}_4</m> now.
	The system
	<me> \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A \amp \uvec{n}_4 \end{array}\right] </me>
	is also consistent,
	and one particular solution is
	<me> \uvec{n}_4' = (2, 0, -4, 0, 3, 0, -2, 0, 0) </me>,
	giving us our needed cyclic space
	<me> W_3 = \Span \{ \uvec{n}_4', A\uvec{n}_4' \} = \Span \{ \uvec{n}_4', \uvec{n}_4 \} </me>.
	</p><p>
	We now have the required collection of <m>A</m>-cyclic subspaces of <m>\R^9</m>.
	Use their cyclic bases to form the matrix <m>P</m>,
	to get

	If we wanted to ensure that this transition matrix is in fact invertible,
	we could compute its rank to be <m>9</m>.
	But actually,
	we will see in <xref ref="proposition-triang-nilpotent-indep-cyclic-with-last-vector-null" />
	that if the collection of terminal null space vectors from each cyclic basis is a linearly independent set,
	then the cyclic subspaces must form an independent collection.
	</p><p>
	Finally, without computing <m>\inv{P} A P</m> we know the form matrix will be
