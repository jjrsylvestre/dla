		Consider <m>18 \times 18</m> matrix

		in triangular-block nilpotent form,
		where the elementary nilpotent blocks <m>N_1</m> and <m>N_2</m> are each <m>5 \times 5</m>,
		blocks <m>N_3</m> and <m>N_4</m> are each <m>3 \times 3</m>,
		and block <m>N_5</m> is <m>2 \times 2</m>.

		Suppose <m>A</m> is another <m>18 \times 18</m> matrix that is similar to <m>N</m>.

		<statement>
			<p> What is the rank of <m>A</m>? </p>
			<p> What is nullity of <m>A</m> (<ie /> the dimension of the null space of <m>A</m>)? </p>
			<p> Describe how and why this number determines the number of blocks in <m>N</m>. </p>

			<p> For the rank, consider <xref ref="corollary-similarity-rank-nullity" />. </p>

			Consider <xref ref="proposition-cayley-hamilton-similar-to-nilpotent" />,

		Continue working backwards,
