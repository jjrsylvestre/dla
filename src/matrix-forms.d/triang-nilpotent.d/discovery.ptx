		Confirm that <m>A</m> is nilpotent, and determine the degree of nilpotency.

<activity xml:id="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim">

	<introduction>

		<p>
		From <xref ref="chapter-block-diag" /> we know that we need a complete set of independent, <m>A</m>-invariant subspaces to produce a block-diagonal form matrix.
		If each block is to be in elementary nilpotent form,
		then from <xref ref="chapter-elem-nilpotent" /> we know that for each block we need a corresponding <m>A</m>-cyclic subspace of <m>\R^n</m>
		(or <m>\C^n</m>, as appropriate).
		</p>

		<p> Suppose <m>W = \Span \{ \uvec{w}, A \uvec{w}, A^2 \uvec{w}, \dotsc \}</m> is one the spaces in this collection. </p>

	</introduction>

	<task><p>
		How is the dimension of <m>W</m> reflected in the corresponding elementary nilpotent block of the triangular-block nilpotent form matrix to which <m>A</m> is similar?
	</p></task>

	<task xml:id="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-vs-generator"><p>
		Let <m>k</m> represent <m>\dim W</m>.
		What must be true about <m>A^k \uvec{w}</m>?
	</p></task>

</activity>


<activity xml:id="activity-triang-nilpotent-independence-of-blocks">

	<introduction>

		<p>
		Let's address the independence requirement of the <m>A</m>-cyclic subspaces we need to achieve triangular-block nilpotent form,
		at least in the case of a set of two such subspaces.
		For this, it is not necessary to actually assume that <m>A</m> is nilpotent.
		</p>

		<p>
		Suppose
		<md><mrow>
			U \amp = \Span \{ \uvec{u}, A \uvec{u}, A^2 \uvec{u} \} \text{,} \amp
			W \amp = \Span \{ \uvec{w}, A \uvec{w} \} \text{,}
		</mrow></md>
		where the provided spanning sets are assumed to independent,
		and generating vectors <m>\uvec{u}</m> and <m>\uvec{w}</m> each satisfy the condition you determined in
		<xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-vs-generator" text="type-local" />
		of <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim" />.
		Further assume that the two final vectors, <m> A^2 \uvec{u} </m> and <m> A \uvec{w} </m>, are independent.
		</p>

	</introduction>

	<task xml:id="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-start"><p>
		Form the vector equation that begins the <xref ref="procedure-linear-indep-concepts-test-for-dep-indep" text="title" />
		for the combined collection <me> \{ \uvec{u}, A \uvec{u}, A^2 \uvec{u}, \uvec{w}, A \uvec{w} \} </me>.
		As there are five vectors in this collection,
		your vector equation will involve five unknown scalars.
	</p></task>

	<task xml:id="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-reduce-one"><p>
		Multiply your vector equation from <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-start" text="type-local" /> through by <m>A^2</m>.
		After applying that condition from
		<xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-vs-generator" text="type-local" />
		of <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim" />
		and simplifying,
		you should immediately be able to conclude that one of the five unknown scalars is zero.
	</p></task>

	<task xml:id="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-reduce-two"><p>
		Use the knowledge from <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-reduce-one" text="type-local" />
		that one of the scalars is zero to simplify your initial vector equation (before having multiplied by <m>A^2</m>)
		from <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-start" text="type-local" />.
		Multiply this simplified vector equation through by <m>A</m>,
		and again use that condition from
		<xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-vs-generator" text="type-local" />
		of <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim" />
		to simplify.
		Now you should be able to use the assumption that <m> A^2 \uvec{u} </m> and <m> A \uvec{w} </m> are independent to conclude that two more of the unknown scalars must be zero.
	</p></task>

	<task><p>
		Use the knowledge from <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-block-dim-reduce-two" text="type-local" />
		that two more of the scalars are zero to simplify your independence vector equation even further.
		You should be able to again use the assumption that <m> A^2 \uvec{u} </m> and <m> A \uvec{w} </m> are independent to conclude that the last two of the unknown scalars must be zero.
	</p></task>

	<task><p>
		Think about how this argument would unfold if the two spaces we started with had larger dimensions:
		<md><mrow>
			U \amp = \Span \{ \uvec{u}, A \uvec{u}, A^2 \uvec{u}, \dotsc, A^{k - 1} \uvec{u} \} \text{,} \amp
			W \amp = \Span \{ \uvec{w}, A \uvec{w}, A^2 \uvec{w}, \dotsc, A^{\ell - 1} \uvec{w} \} \text{.}
		</mrow></md>
	</p></task>

</activity>

<activity xml:id="activity-triang-nilpotent-transition-proc">

	<p>
	In <xref ref="subsection-triang-nilpotent-concepts-proc" />,
	two different procedures for constructing a transition matrix <m>P</m> that will put a given nilpotent matrix <m>A</m> into triangular-block nilpotent form are given.
	If you've made it this far and have time to spare,
	see how far you can make it into applying the first of those two procedures
	(<xref ref="procedure-triang-nilpotent-concepts-form-proc1" />)
	to the <m>9 \times 9</m> matrix from <xref ref="activity-triang-nilpotent-form-from-info" />.
