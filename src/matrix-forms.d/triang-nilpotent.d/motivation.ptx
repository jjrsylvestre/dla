<title>Motivation</title>

<p>
Just as scalar-triangular form was a warm-up for triangular block form,
elementary nilpotent form was a warm-up for what we will call
<term>triangular-block nilpotent form</term>:
<me>
	\begin{bmatrix}
		N_1 \\
		 \amp N_2 \\
		 \amp \amp \ddots \\
		 \amp \amp \amp N_\ell
	\end{bmatrix}
</me>,
where each block <m>N_j</m> is an elementary nilpotent matrix.
</p><p>
The theory behind determining a transition matrix that will take a nilpotent matrix to this new form is technically involved.
While we will provide a procedure to create such a transition matrix in this chapter,
we will be more concerned with just being able to determine the exact form matrix from properties of the original nilpotent matrix.

	Rather than try to compute or observe information directly,
	use more easily obtainable information as clues to the nature of the desired,
	more complicated information.
