<p>
Here we will record some basis facts about generalized eignevectors.
Note that these statements hold for <em>every</em> matrix,
not just those with a single eigenvalue.

	<title>Properties of generalized eigenspaces</title>

	<statement><p>
		Suppose <m>\lambda</m> is an eigenvalue of the <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
		with algebraic multiplicity <m>m</m>.
		Then the following hold.
		<ol>
			<li xml:id="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-is-subspace">
				The generalized eigenspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m> is a subspace of <m>\R^n</m> (or <m>\C^n</m>, as appropriate).
			</li>
			<li xml:id="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-esubsp-subsp-of-gen">
				Each generalized eigensubspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m> is a subspace of the generalized eigenspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m>.
				That is, <m>E^k_\lambda(A) \subseteq G_\lambda(A)</m> for all <m>k \ge 1</m>.
			</li>
			<li xml:id="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-esubsp-subsp-of-next">
				Each generalized eigensubspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m> is a subspace of the next.
				That is, <m>E^k_\lambda(A) \subseteq E^{k+1}_\lambda(A)</m> for all <m>k \ge 1</m>.
			</li>
			<li xml:id="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-dim-gen-espace">
				The dimension of the generalized eigenspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m> is equal to the algebraic multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m>.

			</li>
			<li xml:id="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-gen-subsp-equal-mth-esubsp">
				The generalized eigenspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m> is <em>equal</em> to the <m>\nth[m]</m> generalized eigensubspace of <m>A</m> corresponding to <m>\lambda</m>.

	<proof>
		<title>Proof of <xref ref="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-is-subspace" text="type-local">Statement</xref></title>
		<p>
		You were asked to verify this using the <xref ref="procedure-subspaces-concepts-test" text="title" />
		in <xref ref="activity-scalar-triang-gen-espace-subspace" />.
		Note that when you take two random vectors <m>\uvec{u},\uvec{v}</m> in <m>G_\lambda(A)</m> to begin to show that <m>G_\lambda(A)</m> is closed under addition,
		you cannot assume that they are both in the same null space.
		That is, you know that <m>\uvec{u}</m> is in the null space of <m>(\lambda I -A)^{k_1}</m> for some positive integer <m>k_1</m>,
		and you know that <m>\uvec{v}</m> is in the null space of <m>(\lambda I -A)^{k_2}</m> for some positive integer <m>k_2</m>,
		but you <em>cannot</em> assume that <m>k_1</m> and <m>k_2</m> are equal.

	<proof>
		<title>Proof of <xref ref="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-esubsp-subsp-of-gen" text="type-local">Statement</xref></title>
		<p> This statement should be obvious from the definitions of <m>G_\lambda(A)</m> and <m>E^k_\lambda(A)</m>. </p>
	</proof>

	<proof>
		<title>Proof of <xref ref="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-esubsp-subsp-of-next" text="type-local">Statement</xref></title>
		<p> We leave this as an exercise for you, the reader. </p>

		<title>Proof of <xref ref="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-dim-gen-espace" text="type-local">Statement</xref></title>
		<p>
		We will state and prove this statement as part of
		<xref ref="theorem-triang-block-more-gen-espace-facts" />
		in <xref ref="section-triang-block-theory" />.
		Alternatively, see Exercise 4 in <section-mark/>6.8 of <xref ref="reference-hoff-kunze" />
		for the outline of a direct proof of this statement using the theory of abstract linear operators.

	<proof>
		<title>Proof of <xref ref="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-gen-subsp-equal-mth-esubsp" text="type-local">Statement</xref></title>
		<p>
		This statement could be deduced from
		<xref ref="theorem-scalar-triang-gen-espace-facts-dim-gen-espace">Statement</xref>
		and the fact that <m>\lambda I - A</m>,
		when restricted to the subspace <m>G_\lambda(A)</m>,
		is a <xref ref="definition-cayley-hamilton-nilpotent" text="custom">nilpotent</xref> operator.
		But we will not pursue that discussion here.
