<remark><p>
	An upper triangular matrix that is all zeros except for a line of ones on the first super-diagonal could also be considered to be in
	<term>elementary nilpotent form</term>,
	but we will focus on the lower triangular version because it makes the similarity pattern more obvious.
</p></remark>

<p>
The next two definitions are relative to a specific <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
and can be applied to vectors and subspaces in <m>\R^n</m> or in <m>\C^n</m>,
as appropriate.

	<li>
	<title><m>A</m>-cyclic subspace</title>
	<idx><h>cyclic</h><h>space</h></idx>
	<p>
		a subspace of the form
		<m>\Span \{ \uvec{w}, A \uvec{w}, A^2 \uvec{w}, \dotsc \}</m>
		for some vector <m>\uvec{w}</m>
	</p>
	</li>

</dl></p>

<p>
If we begin with the matrix <m>A</m> and a single vector <m>\uvec{w}</m>,
then we say that
<me>\Span \{ \uvec{w}, A \uvec{w}, A^2 \uvec{w}, \dotsc \}</me>
is the <term><m>A</m>-cyclic subspace generated by <m>\uvec{w}</m></term>.
On the other hand,
if we begin with the matrix <m>A</m> and a subspace <m>W</m>, and are able to identify a vector <m>\uvec{w}</m> in <m>W</m> which generates <m>W</m> as an <m>A</m>-cyclic subspace,
then we say that <m>\uvec{w}</m> is an <term><m>A</m>-cyclic vector for <m>W</m></term>.
