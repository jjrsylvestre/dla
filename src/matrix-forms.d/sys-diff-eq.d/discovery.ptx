	<introduction><p>
		Consider the following <term>coupled system of linear differential equations</term>:

			<p>
			Suppose we create new functions

					z(t) \amp = \amp x(t) \amp - \amp 2 y(t) \text{,}

			Create a new system of differential equations in

			What happened?

		</statement>
		<hint><p>
			Differentiate the expression for <m>w(t)</m> to get a formula for <m>w'(t)</m> in terms of <m>x'(t)</m> and <m>y'(t)</m>.
			Then substitute the expressions for <m>x'(t)</m> and <m>y'(t)</m> from the original differential equations into your expression for <m>w'(t)</m>.
			Simplify, and then see if you can relate what you have back to the change-of-variable expressions for <m>w(t)</m> and <m>z(t)</m>.
			Then repeat for <m>z(t)</m>.

	<task><p>
		Now use the pattern from

		<p>
		If we want to convert these solutions for <m>w(t), z(t)</m> to solutions to for <m>x(t),y(t)</m>,
		we'll need to reverse the change of variables.
		That is, we'll need to solve the system
		<me>
			\left\{\begin{array}{rcrcr}
				- x \amp + \amp y \amp = \amp w \text{,} \\
				x \amp - \amp 2 y \amp = \amp z \text{,}

		</p><p>
		Wait!
		The pattern of the equations above looks familiar <ellipsis />
		Perhaps we could use linear algebra to solve them.
		(And maybe use matrix inversion to solve,
		instead of row reducing.)
		</p><p>
		Once you've solved the reverse change of variables,
		express the solutions for <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> as combinations of the solutions for <m>w(t)</m> and <m>z(t)</m>.

		<xref ref="activity-sys-diff-eq-two-vars-example-change-var-back" text="type-local" />
		demonstrated that the linear change-of-variable equations could be written in matrix form:
		<me>
			\begin{bmatrix} w \\ z \end{bmatrix}
			= \begin{bmatrix}
				<fillin characters="2" /> \amp <fillin characters="2" /> \\
				<fillin characters="2" /> \amp <fillin characters="2" />
			\end{bmatrix}
			\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
		</me>.
		</p><p>
		But the original system of differential equations involving <m>x(t),y(t)</m> also looks linear.
		Can you write that differential system in terms of matrix multiplication as well?
		One side of your matrix equation should involve a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix times
		<m>\left[\begin{smallmatrix} x \\ y \end{smallmatrix}\right]</m>.
		Can you convert the other <q>differential</q> side of the matrix equation into an expression involving
		<m>\left[\begin{smallmatrix} x \\ y \end{smallmatrix}\right]</m>?
		</p><p>
		Can you also turn your simplified system involving <m>w(t),w'(t),z'(t),z(t)</m> into a matrix equation?
		What do you notice about coefficient matrix in this system?
		</p>
	</task>

	<task><p>
		So we have
		<ul>
			<li>
				a coefficient matrix relating
				<m>\ddt \left[\begin{smallmatrix} x \\ y \end{smallmatrix}\right] </m>
				to
				<m>\left[\begin{smallmatrix} x \\ y \end{smallmatrix}\right] </m>,

			<li>
				a coefficient matrix relating coordinate systems

		What recent topic that we've been studying do you think relates these three coefficient matrices together?

	<introduction>

		<p>
		The equation <me> y''(t) + 5 y'(t) + 4 y(t) = 0 </me>

		<p>
			We will try to use vector/matrix methods to solve this equation.
			The vector of unknown functions we will use is
			<me> \mathbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} y(t) \\ y'(t) \end{bmatrix} </me>.
			So, effectively we are setting <m>y_1(t) = y(t)</m> and <m>y_2(t) = y'(t)</m>.
