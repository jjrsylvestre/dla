<title>Motivation</title>

<p>
Finally, we reach the end of our journey to answering <xref ref="question-block-diag-motivation-similarity-class-reps" />.
We know we can make every (complex) matrix similar to one in triangular block form
(<xref ref="theorem-triang-block-form" />).
Each block in triangular block form is a scalar-triangular block that can be broken up into the sum of a scalar part and a nilpotent part.
Using the patterns from <xref ref="activity-elem-nilpotent-moving-past-triang-block" />
and  <xref ref="subsection-elem-nilpotent-concepts-past-triang-block" />,
we saw that can make a triangular block form matrix similar to something simpler by building a second transition matrix in block diagonal form out of blocks that would make the nilpotent part of each scalar-triangular block simpler.
And <q>simpler</q> for a nilpotent matrix means triangular-block nilpotent form.
Putting triangular-block nilpotent form back together with the scalar part of each block in triangular block form,
we get something called <term>Jordan normal form</term>.
