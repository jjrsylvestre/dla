<activity xml:id="activity-linear-indep-test">

	<prelude>
		<p>
		<xref ref="activity-linear-indep-motivation" /> demonstrates a common pattern: when one of the vectors in a spanning set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others, that vector becomes <em>redundant</em>, and a smaller spanning set can be used in place of the original one. We'll give this situation a name: a set of vectors is called
		<term>linearly dependent</term><idx><h>linearly</h><h>dependent</h></idx>
		if (at least) one of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of other vectors in the set; otherwise the set of vectors is called
		<term>linearly independent</term><idx><h>linearly</h><h>independent</h></idx>.
		However, it can be tedious to check each vector in a set one-by-one to see if it is a linear combination of others. Luckily, for a finite set of vectors, there is a way to check all of them all at once.

		<paragraphs><title>Test for Linear Dependence/Independence</title>

		To test whether vectors <m>\uvec{v}_1,\uvec{v}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{v}_m</m> are linearly dependent or independent, set up the vector equation

			k_1\uvec{v}_1 + k_2\uvec{v}_2 + \dotsb + k_m\uvec{v}_m = \zerovec,
		</mrow></md>
		where the coefficients <m>k_1,k_2,\dotsc,k_m</m> are (scalar) variables.
		<ul>
			<li> If vector equation <xref ref="equation-linear-indep-activities-test" /> has a nontrivial solution in the variables <m>k_1,k_2,\dotsc,k_m</m>, then the vectors <m>\uvec{v}_1,\uvec{v}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{v}_m</m> are <term>linearly dependent</term>. </li>
			<li> Otherwise, if vector equation <xref ref="equation-linear-indep-activities-test" /> has <em>only</em> the trivial solution <m>k_1=0,k_2=0,\dotsc,k_m=0</m>, then the vectors <m>\uvec{v}_1,\uvec{v}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{v}_m</m> are <term>linearly independent</term>. </li>

	<prelude><p>The next activity will help you understand the Test for Linear Independence/Dependence. To keep it simple, we'll consider just three vectors at a time.</p></prelude>

	<task>
		<p>
		Consider abstract vectors <m>\uvec{u}_1,\uvec{u}_2,\uvec{u}_3</m>, and suppose the vector equation
		<md><mrow tag="dstar" xml:id="activity-linear-indep-understand-test-equation1">
			k_1\uvec{u}_1 + k_2\uvec{u}_2 + k_3\uvec{u}_3 = \zerovec
		</mrow></md>
		has a nontrivial solution. This means that there are values for the scalars <m>k_1,k_2,k_3</m>, at least one of which is not zero, so that equation <xref ref="activity-linear-indep-understand-test-equation1" /> is true.
		</p><p>
		Use some algebra to manipulate equation <xref ref="activity-linear-indep-understand-test-equation1" /> to demonstrate that one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others (and hence, <em>by definition</em>, the vectors <m>\uvec{u}_1,\uvec{u}_2,\uvec{u}_3</m> are linearly dependent).

	<task>
		<p>
		Consider abstract vectors <m>\uvec{w}_1,\uvec{w}_2,\uvec{w}_3</m>, and suppose the vector equation

		has <em>only</em> the trivial solution. We would like to see why this means that <m>\uvec{w}_1,\uvec{w}_2,\uvec{w}_3</m> are linearly independent.
		</p><p>
		Suppose they weren't: for example, suppose <m>\uvec{v}_3 = c_1\uvec{v}_1 + c_2\uvec{v}_2</m> were true for some scalars <m>c_1,c_2</m>. Manipulate this expression for <m>\uvec{v}_3</m> until is says something about equation
		<xref ref="activity-linear-indep-understand-test-equation2" />. Do you see now why <m>\uvec{v}_1,\uvec{v}_2,\uvec{v}_3</m> <em>cannot</em> satisfy the <em>definition</em> of linearly dependence, and hence must be linearly independent?
