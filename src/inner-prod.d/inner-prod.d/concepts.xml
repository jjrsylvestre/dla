<subsection xml:id="subsection-inner-prod-concepts-axioms">
<title>Inner product axioms</title>

<p> We begin by listing the axioms for a real inner product space once again. </p>

<definition xml:id="definition-inner-prod-concepts-real-inner-prod">
	<title>Real inner product axioms</title>
	<statement>
		<p>
		A <term>real inner product</term><idx><h>inner product</h><h>real</h></idx><idx><h>real</h><h>inner product</h></idx>
		is a pairing that assigns a scalar (<ie /> real number) to each (ordered) pair of vectors in a real vector space,
		according to the following axioms.
		As usual, bold variable letters represent arbitrary vectors in the vector space,
		and ordinary variable letters represent arbitrary scalars (<ie /> real numbers).
		</p>
		<xi:include href="./concepts.d/real-ip-axioms.xml" />
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>
The first three axioms mimic the algebra rules satisfied by the dot product on <m>\R^n</m>.
(See <xref ref="proposition-vector-geom-dot-prod-algebra" />.)
And as explored in <xref ref="activity-inner-prod-why-positive" />,
<xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-real-axioms-positive" text="local">Axiom RIP</xref>
is included to ensure that we will always be able to compute the square root of the result of <m>\uvecinprod{v}{v}</m> for all nonzero vectors <m>\uvec{v}</m>.
(See <xref ref="subsection-inner-prod-concepts-real-geometry" />.)
</p>

<p>
In <xref ref="activity-inner-prod-complex-dot-product" />,
we found that there might be issues with naively transplanting the dot product into <m>\C^n</m>.
We will discuss again these issues and their resolution below,
but for now we will list the properties that the <q>modified</q> complex dot product satisfy as axioms that <em>every</em> complex inner product should satisfy.
</p>

<definition xml:id="definition-inner-prod-concepts-complex-inner-prod">
	<title>Complex inner product axioms</title>
	<statement>
		<p>
		A <term>complex inner product</term><idx><h>inner product</h><h>complex</h></idx><idx><h>complex</h><h>inner product</h></idx>
		is a pairing that assigns a scalar (<ie /> complex number) to each (ordered) pair of vectors in a complex vector space,
		according to the following axioms.
		As usual, bold variable letters represent arbitrary vectors in the vector space,
		and ordinary variable letters represent arbitrary scalars (<ie /> complex numbers).
		</p>
		<xi:include href="./concepts.d/complex-ip-axioms.xml" />
	</statement>
</definition>

<p>
In both cases,
an inner product is required to produce scalar results from vector inputs <mdash />
real scalars in the case of a real inner product,
and complex scalars in the case of a complex inner product.
It is for this reason that an inner product is also sometimes referred to as a <term>scalar product</term>.
</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-inner-prod-concepts-real-geometry">
<title>Geometry in real inner product spaces</title>

<p>
In analogy with the formulas
<md><mrow>
	\unorm{v} \amp = \sqrt{\udotprod{v}{v}} \text{,} \amp
	\theta \amp = \inv{\cos} \left(
		\frac{\udotprod{u}{v}}{\unorm{u}\unorm{v}}
	\right)
</mrow></md>
relating the dot product to the geometry of <m>\R^n</m>,
we make the following definitions in <em>real</em> inner product spaces:
<md><mrow>
	\unorm{v} \amp = \sqrt{\uvecinprod{v}{v}} \text{,} \amp
	\theta \amp = \inv{\cos} \left(
		\frac{\uvecinprod{u}{v}}{\unorm{u}\unorm{v}}
	\right) \text{.}
</mrow></md>
<xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-real-axioms-positive" text="local">Axiom RIP</xref>
ensures that the formula for norm of a vector always makes sense.
Also, <xref ref="theorem-vector-geom-cauchy-schwarz" text="title" />
remains true when the dot product is replaced by the inner product of any real inner product space,
which ensures that the formula for the angle between two vectors always makes sense.
(See the discussion in <xref ref="subsection-vector-geom-concepts-angle-in-Rn" />,
imagining the dot product in <m>\R^n</m> replaced by the inner product in a real inner product space.)
</p><p>
These formulas answer the questions in <xref ref="section-inner-prod-motivation" />:
yes, a matrix does have <q>length</q>
(though we will call it <term>norm</term> instead of length); and
yes, two functions can be <q>perpendicular</q> to each other
(though we will call it <term>orthogonal</term>, as in <xref ref="chapter-orthog" />).
See <xref ref="subsection-inner-prod-examples-geometry" /> for examples of these calculations.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-inner-prod-concepts-Cn-dot-product">
<title>Norm and the dot product in <m>\C^n</m></title>

<p>
As we reminded ourselves in <xref ref="activity-inner-prod-complex-dot-product" />,
we already have a way to compute length in <m>\C^1</m>, the complex plane:
for <m>z = a + b \ci</m>, the complex modulus
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-inner-prod-concepts-complex-modulus" tag="star">
	\cmodulus{z} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
</mrow></md>
is the distance from the origin to the point in the complex plane corresponding to <m>z</m>.
If we imagine <m>z</m> as not just a point but as a vector from the origin to that terminal point instead,
then <m>\cmodulus{z}</m> is the length of that vector.
</p><p>
Just as norm in <m>\R^n</m> for increasing <m>n</m> follows the pattern
<md>
	<mrow> \text{in } \R^1 \amp \text{:} \amp \norm{(x_1)} \amp = \sqrt{x_1^2} = \abs{x_1} \text{,} </mrow>
	<mrow> \text{in } \R^2 \amp \text{:} \amp \norm{(x_1,x_2)} \amp = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2} \text{,} </mrow>
	<mrow> \text{in } \R^3 \amp \text{:} \amp \norm{(x_1,x_2,x_3)} \amp = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2} \text{,} </mrow>
</md>
and so on,
it seems it would make sense to have norm in <m>\C^n</m> follow a similar pattern, starting at
<xref ref="equation-inner-prod-concepts-complex-modulus" />:
<md>
	<mrow> \text{in } \C^1 \amp \text{:} \amp \norm{(z_1)} \amp = \sqrt{\cmodulus{z_1}^2} = \cmodulus{z_1} \text{,} </mrow>
	<mrow> \text{in } \C^2 \amp \text{:} \amp \norm{(z_1,z_2)} \amp = \sqrt{\cmodulus{z_1}^2 + \cmodulus{z_2}^2} \text{,} </mrow>
	<mrow> \text{in } \C^3 \amp \text{:} \amp \norm{(z_1,z_2,z_3)} \amp = \sqrt{\cmodulus{z_1}^2 + \cmodulus{z_2}^2 + \cmodulus{z_3}^2} \text{,} </mrow>
</md>
and so on.
</p><p>
To trace this back to an appropriate complex inner product on <m>\C^n</m>
(as we attempted to do in <xref ref="activity-inner-prod-complex-dot-product" />),
the formula
<me> \cmodulus{z}^2 = z\cconj{z} </me>
seems to suggest that the dot product
<me> \udotprod{x}{y} = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + \dotsb + x_n y_n </me>
from <m>\R^n</m> needs a complex conjugate in it in to adapt it for use in <m>\C^n</m>:
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-inner-prod-concepts-complex-dot-product" tag="dstar">
	\udotprod{w}{z} = w_1 \cconj{z}_1 + w_2 \cconj{z}_2 + \dotsb + w_n \cconj{z}_n
</mrow></md>.
</p><p>
This definition of the <term>standard inner product</term> on <m>\C^n</m> satisfies
<xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-complex-axioms-positive" text="local">Axiom CIP</xref>,
and so the formula
<me> \unorm{z} = \sqrt{\udotprod{z}{z}} </me>
both makes sense mathematically and matches up with the pattern of norms in <m>\C^n</m> explored above.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-inner-prod-concepts-complex-axioms">
<title>Complex inner products</title>

<p>
Just as we used dot product on <m>\R^n</m> as the model for the axioms for real inner products,
we use the complex dot product on <m>\C^n</m> as the model for the axioms for complex inner products.
This explains the differences between the two sets of axioms (real and complex).
</p><p>
Using <xref ref="equation-inner-prod-concepts-complex-dot-product" />,
we see that
<md>
	<mrow> \udotprod{z}{w} \amp = z_1 \cconj{w}_1 + z_2 \cconj{w}_2 + \dotsb + z_n \cconj{w}_n </mrow>
	<mrow> \amp = \lcconj{\cconj{z}_1 w_1 + \cconj{z}_2 w_2 + \dotsb + \cconj{z}_n w_n} </mrow>
	<mrow> \amp = \lcconj{\udotprod{w}{z}} </mrow>
</md>,
which leads to <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-complex-axioms-symmetric" text="local">Axiom CIP</xref>.
</p><p>
As well, in analogy with geometric length in <m>\R^2</m> and <m>\R^3</m>,
we would like a norm to always be a real number.
So while <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-complex-axioms-positive" text="local">Axiom CIP</xref>
is essentially the same in content as <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-real-axioms-positive" text="local">Axiom RIP</xref>,
we chose in <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-complex-axioms-positive" text="local">Axiom CIP</xref>
to explicitly specify that the result of <m>\uvecinprod{v}{v}</m> should be real,
since in general a complex inner product will output complex results.
</p>
<aside><title>Check your understanding</title><p>
	Use <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-complex-axioms-symmetric" text="local">Axiom CIP</xref>
	to verify that it is actually unnecessary to explicitly specify in
	<xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-complex-axioms-positive" text="local">Axiom CIP</xref>
	that <m>\uvecinprod{v}{v}</m> should be real.
</p></aside>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-inner-prod-concepts-complex-geometry">
<title>Geometry in complex inner product spaces</title>

<p>
Norm in <m>\C^n</m> was our guide to creating the complex dot product,
and <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-complex-axioms-positive" text="local">Axiom CIP</xref>
allows us to use the same definition of norm in any complex inner product space:
<me> \unorm{z} = \sqrt{\uvecinprod{z}{z}} </me>.
</p><p>
It is possible to also use a complex inner product to define angle between vectors in a complex inner product space,
but we will not have a need to, so we will leave that matter for your future studies.
However, there is one special angle, <m>\theta = \pi/2</m>, that will play an important role in the following chapters,
so while we will not study angles in general we will still make use of the concept of <term>orthogonal vectors</term>.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-inner-prod-concepts-matrix-mult">
<title>Dot products as matrix multiplication</title>

<p>
In <xref ref="subsection-vector-geom-concepts-dot-prod-vs-matrix-mult" />,
we discussed how dot product on <m>\R^n</m> is essentially just matrix multiplication.
Viewing vectors in <m>\R^n</m> as <m>n \times 1</m> column vectors,
we have
<me> \udotprod{u}{v} = \utrans{\uvec{u}} \uvec{v} = \utrans{\uvec{v}} \uvec{u} </me>.
As in <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-real-axioms-symmetric" text="local">Axiom RIP</xref>,
the order doesn't matter, so we can use either of the two expressions above.
</p><p>
For a complex inner product, the order does matter.
We can still realize the complex dot product on <m>\C^n</m> as matrix multiplication,
but it will look different in different orders of matrix multiplication:
<me> \udotprod{w}{z} = \utrans{\uvec{w}} \cconj{\uvec{z}} = \utrans{\cconj{\uvec{z}}} \uvec{w} </me>.
Since we have already combined conjugate-transpose into a single computation,
the <term>complex adjoint</term>,
we will prefer the <q>reversed order</q> expression:
<me> \udotprod{w}{z} = \adjoint{\uvec{z}} \uvec{w} </me>.
And to maintain consistency,
we will also prefer the <q>reversed order</q> expression for the real dot product:
<me> \udotprod{u}{v} = \utrans{\uvec{v}} \uvec{u} </me>.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-inner-prod-concepts-modified-dot-product">
<title>Other inner products on <m>\R^n</m> and <m>\C^n</m></title>

<paragraphs><title>Inner products on <m>\R^n</m></title>
<p>
In <xref ref="activity-inner-prod-Rn-others" />,
we explored modifying the formula
<me> \udotprod{u}{v} = \utrans{\uvec{v}} \uvec{u} </me>
to produce other inner products on <m>\R^n</m>.
Recognizing that there is a secret identity matrix in the dot-product-as-matrix-multiplication formula,
<me> \udotprod{u}{v} = \utrans{\uvec{v}} I \uvec{u} </me>,
we explored the conditions on an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> so that
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-inner-prod-concepts-modified-real-dot-product" tag="dagger">
	\uvecinprod{u}{v} = \utrans{\uvec{v}} A \uvec{u}
</mrow></md>
would also satisfy the axioms for a real inner product.
</p><p>
While we came up with some interesting observations in the case <m>n = 2</m> in <xref ref="activity-inner-prod-Rn-others" />,
the direct approach is best here.
<ul>
	<li>
		Every pairing <xref ref="equation-inner-prod-concepts-modified-real-dot-product" />
		will satisfy <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-real-axioms-additive" text="local">Axiom RIP</xref>
		and <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-real-axioms-homogeneous" text="local">Axiom RIP</xref>.
	</li>
	<li>
		For pairing <xref ref="equation-inner-prod-concepts-modified-real-dot-product" />
		to satisfy <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-real-axioms-symmetric" text="local">Axiom RIP</xref>,
		it is necessary that <m>A</m> be symmetric.
	</li>
	<li>
		For pairing <xref ref="equation-inner-prod-concepts-modified-real-dot-product" />
		to satisfy <xref ref="list-inner-prod-concepts-real-axioms-positive" text="local">Axiom RIP</xref>,
		it is necessary that <m>\utrans{\uvec{x}} A \uvec{x} \gt 0</m> for all nonzero column vectors <m>\uvec{x}</m> in <m>\R^n</m>.
	</li>
</ul>
The last condition is best left as it is, instead of trying to get more specific about properties of <m>A</m> and its entries that would guarantee this property.
A real matrix <m>A</m> that satisfies both of above the conditions necessary to generate an inner product on <m>\R^n</m> is called a
<term><xref ref="definition-inner-product-pos-def-real" text="custom">positive definite matrix</xref></term>.
</p><p>
Positive definite matrices are easy to construct:
if <m>P</m> is any invertible matrix,
then <m>A = \utrans{P} P</m> is always positive definite.
And it also turns out that
<alert>every inner product on <m>\R^n</m> is of the form
<xref ref="equation-inner-prod-concepts-modified-real-dot-product" />
for some positive definite matrix <m>A</m></alert>.
(See <xref ref="subsection-inner-prod-theory-Rn-Cn" />,
where these two facts are stated formally.)
</p><p>
Notice what happens if we construct a pairing using <m>A = \utrans{P} P</m>:
<me>
	\uvecinprod{u}{v}
	= \utrans{\uvec{v}} \utrans{P} P \uvec{u}
	= \utrans{(P \uvec{v})} (P \uvec{u})
	= \dotprod{(P \uvec{u})}{(P \uvec{v})}
</me>.
Recall that every invertible matrix <m>P</m> is somehow a transition matrix
(<xref ref="proposition-change-of-basis-invertible-is-transition" />).
So the above calculation can be interpreted as saying that <em>the new inner product on <m>\R^n</m> afforded by positive definite matrix <m>A = \utrans{P} P</m> is equivalent to the dot product by first <em>transforming</em> <m>\R^n</m> by <m>P</m></em>.
</p>
</paragraphs>

<paragraphs><title>Inner products on <m>\C^n</m></title>
<p>
Everything works almost exactly the same for <m>\C^n</m> as for <m>\R^n</m>,
except now it requires that the complex matrix <m>A</m> be <em>self-adjoint</em> positive definite
(instead of merely <em>symmetric</em> positive definite)
in order for the pairing
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-inner-prod-concepts-modified-complex-dot-product" tag="ddagger">
	\uvecinprod{w}{z} = \adjoint{\uvec{z}} A \uvec{w}
</mrow></md>
to be a complex inner product.
Regarding the positive definite condition,
it is not obvious but the self-adjoint condition also guarantees that <m>\adjoint{\uvec{z}} A \uvec{z}</m>
is always real for every column vector <m>\uvec{z}</m> in <m>\C^n</m>,
making the comparison <m>\adjoint{\uvec{z}} A \uvec{x} \gt 0</m> actually meaningful.
</p><p>
Just as in the real case,
complex positive definite matrices are easy to construct:
if <m>P</m> is any invertible complex matrix,
then <m>A = \adjoint{P} P</m> is always positive definite.
And again, it also turns out that
<alert>every inner product on <m>\C^n</m> is of the form
<xref ref="equation-inner-prod-concepts-modified-complex-dot-product" />
for some positive definite matrix <m>A</m></alert>.
(Again, see <xref ref="subsection-inner-prod-theory-Rn-Cn" />,
where these two facts are stated formally.)
</p><p>
Just as in the real case, if we construct a pairing using <m>A = \adjoint{P} P</m>:
<me>
	\uvecinprod{w}{z}
	= \adjoint{\uvec{z}} \adjoint{P} P \uvec{w}
	= \adjoint{(P \uvec{z})} (P \uvec{w})
	= \dotprod{(P \uvec{w})}{(P \uvec{z})}
</me>.
So again we can say that <em>the new inner product on <m>\C^n</m> afforded by positive definite matrix <m>A = \adjoint{P} P</m> is equivalent to the complex dot product by first <em>transforming</em> <m>\C^n</m> by <m>P</m></em>.
