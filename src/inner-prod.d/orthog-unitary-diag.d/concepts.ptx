<subsection xml:id="subsection-orthog-unitary-diag-concepts-hermitian">
<title>Diagonalization of Hermitian and symmetric matrices</title>

<p>
Our first test case,
explored in <xref ref="activity-orthog-unitary-diag-hermitian-exmp" />,
was of a Hermitian matrix.
In that discovery activity,
with a full slate of linearly independent eigenvectors provided,
we were easily able to produce a transition matrix <m>P</m> so that <m>\inv{P} H P</m> was diagonal.
And, since the provided eigenvectors were already orthogonal,
to convert <m>P</m> into a unitary matrix <m>U</m> so that <m>\adjoint{U} H U</m> was diagonal,
all that was required was to normalize the eigenvectors to unit vectors.
</p>
<aside><title>Note</title><p>
	Since <m>\adjoint{U} = \inv{U}</m> for a unitary matrix <m>U</m>,
	the similarity-like formula <m>\adjoint{U} H U</m> really is a similarity formula.
</p></aside>
<p>
As considered in <xref ref="activity-orthog-unitary-diag-hermitian-exmp-what-if-not-orthog">Discovery</xref>,
the crucial fact to make this work was that the eigenvectors were orthogonal,
since unit vectors are then easy to produce by normalization.
</p><p>
Now, it may seem that lack of orthogonality is also easy to <q>fix</q> using the Gram-Schmidt process,
and indeed we could use that process to convert an eigenspace basis into an orthogonal one.
But as we found in the non-Hermitian example of <xref ref="activity-orthog-unitary-diag-non-exmp" />,
it won't work to fix eigenvectors from <em>different</em> eigenspaces that are not orthogonal to each other.
In trying to correct a lack of one crucial property (orthogonality of basis vectors),
Gram-Schmidt may affect the other crucial property for diagonalization: basis vectors must be eigenvectors.

<p>
Just as the fact that eigenvectors from different eigenspaces are automatically linearly independent
(<xref ref="proposition-diagonalization-indep-e-vectors" />)
was crucial to the process for diagonalization,
eigenvectors from different eigenspaces being orthogonal is crucial to the prospect of being able to orthogonally/unitarily diagonalize a given matrix.
Not every matrix has this property,
but in <xref ref="activity-orthog-unitary-diag-hermitian-orthog-evecs" /> we discovered that self-adjoint matrices do have this property.
And, in fact,
we will prove in <xref ref="subsection-orthog-unitary-diag-theory-diag" /> that
<alert>every self-adjoint matrix is orthogonally/unitarily diagonalizable</alert>.
</p><p>
It turns out that this is the end of the story in the real case <mdash />
a real matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable if and only if it is symmetric
(<xref ref="theorem-orthog-unitary-diag-symmetric-is-orthog-diag" />).
So we will give a procedure for the real case now.
(And essentially the same procedure will work for Hermitian matrices in the complex case.)
</p>

<algorithm xml:id="procedure-orthog-unitary-diag-symmetric">
	<title>Orthogonal diagonalization of a symmetric matrix</title>
	<p>
	Given a real, <m>n \times n</m>, symmetric matrix <m>S</m>,
	we can construct an orthogonal transition matrix <m>P</m> so that <m>\inv{P} S P = \utrans{P} S P</m> is diagonal follows.
	<ol>
		<li>
			Compute the eigenvalues of <m>S</m>.
			For each eigenvalue, compute a basis for the corresponding eigenspace.

		<li>

		<li> Form the <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>P</m> whose columns are the orthonormal eigenspace vectors from the third step collected all together. </li>
	</ol>
	Since the columns of <m>P</m> are constructed to be an orthonormal basis of <m>\R^n</m>,
	this transition matrix will be orthogonal
	(<xref ref="theorem-matrix-adjoints-prod-preserv-equiv-ortho-cols">Statement</xref>
	of <xref ref="theorem-matrix-adjoints-prod-preserv-equiv" />).

	we will have <m>\inv{P} S P = \utrans{P} S P = D</m>,
	a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of <m>S</m> down the diagonal

<subsection xml:id="subsection-orthog-unitary-diag-concepts-normal">
<title>Diagonalization of normal matrices</title>

<p>
As <xref ref="activity-orthog-unitary-diag-non-hermitian-exmp" /> demonstrated,
not every unitarily diagonalizable complex matrix is Hermitian.
One property that unitarily diagonalizable matrices possess that does not seem to be exclusive to Hermitian matrices is commutativity with its own adjoint
(see <xref ref="activity-orthog-unitary-diag-explore-normal" />).
A complex matrix with this property is called a <xref ref="definition-orthog-unitary-diag-normal" text="title" />.
And we will prove that normal matrices have the crucial property of orthogonal eigenspaces
(see <xref ref="theorem-orthog-unitary-diag-normal-eval-evec-props-orthog-evecs">Statement</xref>
of <xref ref="theorem-orthog-unitary-diag-normal-eval-evec-props-orthog-evecs" />),
so that <alert>every normal matrix is unitarily diagonalizable</alert>
(see <xref ref="theorem-orthog-unitary-diag-iff-normal" />).
</p><p>
Since each self-adjoint matrix obviously commutes with itself,
every Hermitian matrix is normal,
and it seems like we have now completely characterized the class of unitarily diagonalizable matrices.
And the procedure to unitarily diagonalize a complex normal matrix is essentially identical to the procedure to orthogonally diagonalize a real symmetric matrix.
