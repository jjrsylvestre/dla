<introduction>

	<p> Recall that two vectors <m>\uvec{u},\uvec{v}</m> in <m>\R^n</m> are called <term>orthogonal</term> if <m>\udotprod{u}{v} = 0</m>. </p>

	<p> In analogy with this, we will also call two vectors <m>\uvec{u},\uvec{v}</m> in an inner product space <term>orthogonal</term> if <m>\uvecinprod{u}{v} = 0</m>. </p>

A set of vectors in an inner product space is called an <term>orthogonal set</term> if each vector in the set is orthogonal to every other vector in the set.

		A basic problem in an inner product space is how to come up with an orthogonal basis.
		So let's invent a procedure for doing so.
	</p></prelude>

	<introduction>

		<p>
		To keep it simple, let's suppose <m>V</m> has dimension <m>3</m>.
		The beginning ingredient for our procedure is <em>some</em> (probably non-orthogonal) basis
		<m>\basisfont{B}_0 = \{\uvec{v}_1,\uvec{v}_2,\uvec{v}_3\}</m>,
		and the end result should be some <em>definitely</em> orthogonal basis
		<m>\basisfont{B} = \{\uvec{e}_1,\uvec{e}_2,\uvec{e}_3\}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
		To get the process started,
		we might as well first choose <m>\uvec{e}_1 = \uvec{v}_1</m>,
		since we don't yet have any other <m>\uvec{e}_j</m> vectors chosen yet to which <m>\uvec{e}_1</m> needs to be orthogonal.
		</p>

		<p> The rest of the activity requires us to choose <m>\uvec{e}_2,\uvec{e}_3</m> to complete the orthogonal basis. </p>
