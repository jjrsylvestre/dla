	Recall that for <m>\uvec{u} = (u_1,u_2,\dotsc,u_n)</m> and <m>\uvec{v} = (v_1,v_2,\dotsc,v_n)</m>, the <term>dot product</term> of <m>\uvec{u}</m> and <m>\uvec{v}</m> is defined by the formula given below on the left. It is an important formula because if <m>\theta</m> is the angle between two nonzero vectors <m>\uvec{u}</m> and <m>\uvec{v}</m>, then <m>\theta</m> satisfies both <m>0 \le \theta \le \pi</m> and the formula given below on the right.

	Orthogonal projection onto a plane in <m>\R^3</m> is a little more complicated, and would typically be discussed in a second course in linear algebra. So we will try a different strategy to determine the distance from a point to a plane in <m>\R^3</m>.

	<p>
	Consider the plane <m>\Pi\colon x - y + 2z = 0</m> and the point <m>Q(2,-3,6)</m> in <m>\R^3</m>. We want to determine the distance <m>d</m> between <m>Q</m> and <m>\Pi</m>; that is, the distance between <m>Q</m> and the point <m>P</m> that lies perpendicularly below <m>Q</m>. From the diagram below, we see that <m>d</m> is equal to the norm of a particular scalar multiple of the normal vector <m>n</m>. Do you remember how to obtain <m>\uvec{n}</m> from the equation for <m>\Pi</m>? Do you remember how to use <m>\uvec{u} = \abray{OQ}</m> to compute this particular scalar multiple of <m>\uvec{n}</m>?
