  <statement>
    <p>Suppose <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are <q>mystery</q> numbers, but you have a clue to their identities: you know that both <m>x-2y=-4</m> and <m>2x+y=2</m> are true.</p>
    <p><em>Without</em> determining the values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, answer each of the following with a <em>number</em>.</p>

  <statement>
    <p>We can work with a system of equations more efficiently by representing it compactly as an <term>augmented matrix</term>. For example,</p>

    <p>Do you understand how this system was turned into a matrix? Now perform the following calculations, but <em>using the matrix, obtaining a new matrix at each step</em>.</p>
    <p><ol label="alph">
      <li xml:id="activity-systems-towards-row-red-reduce-step1">Change the order of the equations: interchange the first and third equations.</li>
      <li xml:id="activity-systems-towards-row-red-reduce-step2">Starting with your new system from the previous step, subtract <m>3</m> times the first equation from the second equation, and add <m>2</m> times the first equation to the third equation.</li>
      <li xml:id="activity-systems-towards-row-red-reduce-step3">Starting with your new system from the previous step, multiply the second equation by <m>1/3</m>.</li>
      <li>Your final result from the previous step should be a <q>simplified</q> matrix. Turn this matrix back into a system of equations and see how much easier it is to solve the system.</li>
