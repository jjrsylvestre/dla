<title>Row operations versus equation manipulations</title>

<p>
Let's examine the operations in <xref ref="activity-systems-towards-row-red" /> in detail, by considering the operations as both <em>equation manipulations</em> and <em>row operations</em> simultaneously.
</p><p>
In each step, notice how the row<m>\leftrightarrow</m>equation and column<m>\leftrightarrow</m>variable correspondence is preserved.

		\amp\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
			-2 \amp 2 \amp -5 \amp -1 \\
			3 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp 9 \\
			1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp 2
		\end{array}\right]
		\amp
		\amp\left\{\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
			-2x \amp + \amp 2y \amp - \amp 5z \amp = \amp -1 \\
			3x \amp   \amp    \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp 9 \\
			x  \amp - \amp  y \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp 2
			\end{array}\right.

		\amp\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
			1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp 2 \\
			3 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp 9 \\
			-2 \amp 2 \amp -5 \amp -1
		\end{array}\right]
		\amp
		\amp\left\{\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
			x  \amp - \amp  y \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp 2 \\
			3x \amp   \amp    \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp 9 \\

Subtract <m>3</m> times the first row/equation from the second row/equation. For the equation version, we do this by performing the same combination of left- and right-hand sides, collecting terms on the left.
<md>
	<mrow>
		(\text{LHS}_2) - 3(\text{LHS}_1) \amp = (\text{RHS}_2) - 3(\text{RHS}_1)
	</mrow>
	<mrow>
		(3x + 3z) - 3(x-y+3z) \amp = 9 - 3(2)
	</mrow>
	<mrow>
		0x + 3y - 6z \amp = 3.
	</mrow>
</md>
Notice that when collecting terms, we ended up performing that <q>subtract <m>3</m> times the first from the second</q> on the coefficients of each variable. So we can achieve the same result in the matrix by performing <q>subtract <m>3</m> times the entry in the first row from the entry in the second row,</q> one column at a time.
<md><mrow>
		\amp\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
			1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp 2 \\
			0 \amp 3 \amp -6 \amp 3 \\
			-2 \amp 2 \amp -5 \amp -1
		\end{array}\right]
		\amp
		\amp\left\{\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
			x  \amp - \amp  y \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp 2 \\
		      \amp   \amp 3y \amp - \amp 6z \amp = \amp 3 \\
			-2x \amp + \amp 2y \amp - \amp 5z \amp = \amp -1
		\end{array}\right.
</mrow></md>
Next, add <m>2</m> times the first row/equation to the third row/equation:
<md>
	<mrow>
		(\text{LHS}_3) + 2(\text{LHS}_1) \amp = (\text{RHS}_3) + 2(\text{RHS}_1)
	</mrow>
	<mrow>
		(-2x+2y-5z)+2(x-y+3z) \amp = -1+2(2)
	</mrow>
	<mrow>
		z \amp = 3.
	</mrow>
</md>
<md><mrow>
	\amp\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
		1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp 2 \\
		0 \amp 3 \amp -6 \amp 3 \\
		0 \amp 0 \amp  1 \amp 3
	\end{array}\right]
	\amp
	\amp\left\{\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
		 x  \amp - \amp  y \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp 2 \\
		    \amp   \amp 3y \amp - \amp 6z \amp = \amp 3 \\
		    \amp   \amp    \amp   \amp  z \amp = \amp 3
	\end{array}\right.
</mrow></md>
Finally, multiply the second row/equation by 1/3:
<md>
	<mrow>
		(1/3)(\text{LHS}_2) \amp = (1/3)(\text{RHS}_2)
	</mrow>
	<mrow>
		(1/3)(3y-6z) \amp = (1/3)(3)
	</mrow>
	<mrow>
		y-2z \amp = 1.
	</mrow>
</md>
<md><mrow>
	\amp\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
		1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp 2 \\
		0 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp 1 \\
		0 \amp 0 \amp  1 \amp 3
	\end{array}\right]
	\amp
	\amp\left\{\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
		 x  \amp - \amp  y \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp 2 \\
		    \amp   \amp  y \amp - \amp 2z \amp = \amp 1 \\
		    \amp   \amp    \amp   \amp  z \amp = \amp 3
	\end{array}\right.
</mrow></md>
The final system on the right is much easier to solve: we can see immediately from the third equation that <m>z=3</m>, then can use this in the second equation to determine <m>y=7</m>, and finally can use both of these in the first equation to determine <m>x=0</m>.

<title>A Look Ahead</title>
<p>
In
<xref ref="chapter-row-red" />,
we will develop a systematic method of simplifying a system in this manner, but working exclusively with augmented matrices. Also, we will take the process a few steps further to make the system as simple as possible. Notice how <q>back-solving</q> the system proceeds from bottom-right to top-left. We will use the same process when solving systems using matrices.
