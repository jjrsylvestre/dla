<introduction><p>
	Here we will recap all of the facts we discussed in
	<xref ref="section-det-by-row-red-concepts" />,
	as well as add in a fact from
	<xref ref="activity-det-by-row-red-det-row-zeros" />.
	We have already adequately discussed the ideas behind most of these facts,
	so for most of them we will not include a proof.
</p></introduction>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-det-by-row-red-theory-row-ops">
<title>Effect of row operations on the determinant</title>

<p> We begin by recording a fact that helped us in our exploration of the effect of swapping rows on the determinant. </p>

<lemma xml:id="lemma-det-by-row-red-odd-adj-row-swaps">

	<statement><p>
		Any row swap can be achieved by a sequence of an <em>odd</em> number of adjacent row swaps.
	</p></statement>

	<proof><title>Proof idea</title><p>
		Suppose you want to swap rows <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m> in a matrix using only adjacent row swaps,
		where <m>R</m> appears higher in the matrix than <m>R'</m>,
		and they are separated by <m>m</m> other rows.
		First move <m>R</m> down, one adjacent row swap at a time,
		until it is in the position just above <m>R'</m>.
		Then swap <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m>, which are now adjacent.
		Finally, move <m>R'</m> up, one adjacent row swap at a time,
		until it is in the original position of <m>R</m>.
		Count the number of adjacent swaps that have been made as an expression in <m>m</m>,
		and notice that it is odd.
	</p></proof>

	<!-- Detailed proof, if desired... -->
	<!--<proof>
		<p>
		Suppose we want to swap two rows <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m> in a matrix,
		where <m>R</m> appears somewhere above <m>R'</m>,
		and there are <m>m</m> other rows between them.
		(We will label these rows as <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m>, even after we have moved them around.)
		</p><p>
		Since there are <m>m</m> rows below <m>R</m> before <m>R'</m> appears,
		by swapping <m>R</m> with the row immediately below it <m>m</m> times,
		we will end up with <m>R</m> immediately above <m>R'</m> then one more adjacent swap gets <m>R'</m> above <m>R</m>.

		We can reverse what we initially did with <m>R</m> but with <m>R'</m>.

		</me>
		We have now swapped the positions of <m>R</m> and <m>R'</m>,
		the <m>m</m> rows between them are still in their original order,
		and we achieved it with <m>m+1+m = 2m+1</m> adjacent row swaps.
		And since <m>2m</m> is even, <m>2m+1</m> is odd.
