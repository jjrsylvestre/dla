	<introduction><p>
		In the preamble to
		<xref ref="activity-inverses-identity-matrix" />,
		there were two ingredients necessary to make the algebra work:
		<ul>
			<li>there is a special number <m>1</m> so that <m>1a=a</m> for all numbers <m>a</m>; and</li>
			<li>
				for a nonzero number like <m>5</m>,
				there is a <term>multiplicative inverse</term> <m>1/5</m> so that <m>(1/5)\cdot 5 = 1</m>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		Multiplicative inverses are very useful in algebra,
		so we would also like to have them in matrix algebra.

		<p>
		<xref ref="activity-inverses-intro-to-inverse" />
		demonstrates that some square matrices have multiplicative inverses
		(<ie /> are <term>invertible</term><idx><h>invertible</h></idx>)
		and some do not
		(called <term>singular</term><idx><h>singular</h></idx> in this case).
		If square matrix <m>A</m> is invertible,
		write <m>\inv{A}</m> for its inverse.
		(But <em>never</em> write <m>1/A</m>!)
		This inverse is <em>defined</em> by its relationship to <m>A</m> and <m>I</m>:
		<m>\inv{A}</m> is the square matrix of the same size as <m>A</m> so that both <m>A\inv{A} = I</m> and <m>\inv{A}A = I</m> are true.
		</p>
		<aside><title>Check your understanding</title><p>
			Do you understand why we must assert that <em>both</em> <m>A\inv{A} = I</m> and <m>\inv{A}A = I</m> are true in defining the inverse <m>\inv{A}</m>?
			Maybe look back at

		For this activity,
