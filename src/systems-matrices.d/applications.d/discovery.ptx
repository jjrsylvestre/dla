<title>Discovery guide</title>

<introduction>
	<p>
	In this set of discovery activities,
	we look at some places where linear systems naturally arise.
	</p>
</introduction>

<activity xml:id="activity-applications-network">
	<p>
	Use the Law of Conservation
	(in this case, <em>flow in equals flow out</em> at each point of intersection)
	in the flow network below to set up a system of equations to determine the internal flow rates.
	(Do not solve your system.)

<activity xml:id="activity-applications-chem-eq">
	<p>
	Set up a system of equations to balance the chemical equation:
	<me>a\mathrm{NH_3} + b\mathrm{O_2} \rightarrow c\mathrm{NO} + d\mathrm{H_2O}.</me>
	Do not solve your system.
	</p>
	<aside>
		<title> No shortcuts </title>
		<p>
		You might have learned some procedure for balancing a chemical equation in high school.
		We are not interested in that procedure.
		We would like to see how attempting to balance a chemical equation has a linear system at its root.

</activity>

<activity xml:id="activity-applications-interpolate-line"><p>
	Any two (distinct) points in the Cartesian plane determine a unique line.
	Set up a system of equations that would let you solve for the slope and <m>y</m>-intercept of the line <m>y=mx+b</m> that passes through the points <m>(-3,4)</m> and <m>(2,-1)</m>
	(but do not solve the system).
	Write down the augmented matrix for your system.
</p></activity>

<activity xml:id="activity-applications-interpolate-parabola"><p>
	Any three (distinct, non-collinear) points in the Cartesian plane determine a unique parabola.
	Set up a system of equations that would let you solve for the coefficients <m>a,b,c</m> of the parabola <m>y=ax^2+bx+c</m> that passes through the points
	<m>(-1,-4)</m>, <m>(1,0)</m>, and <m>(2,5)</m>
	(but do not solve the system).
	Write down the augmented matrix for your system.
</p></activity>

<activity xml:id="activity-applications-interpolate-degree-n"><p>
	Based on the previous two activities and their answers,
	how many points are necessary to determine a unique degree <m>n</m> polynomial
	<m>y=a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dotsb + a_1 x + a_0</m>?
	If you knew such points
	<me>(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3),\dotsc,</me>
	and you used these points to create a linear system to determine the coefficients of the polynomial,
	what would be the pattern in the rows of the resulting augmented matrix for the system?
</p></activity>
