			</title>
			<p>
			We need to verify that there is <em>at least one</em> example of a system

			is true,
			so that there is at least one example of a system
			<m>A\uvec{x}=\uvec{b}</m>
			that has one unique solution.
			Imagine trying to solve this system by row reducing the associated augmented matrix:
			<me>
				\left[\begin{array}{c|c} A \amp \uvec{b} \end{array}\right]
				\rowredarrow
				\left[\begin{array}{c|c} \RREF(A) \amp \uvec{b}' \end{array}\right],

			When we have arrived at the RREF of <m>A</m> in the coefficient matrix part on the left,
			and are ready to solve the simplified solution,
			there should not be be any free variables.
			Because free variables would lead to parameters,
			and hence infinite solutions,
			whereas we are assuming that this particular system has only one unique solution.
			So <em>every</em> column in the RREF of <m>A</m> must have a leading one.
			By definition,
			the rank of <m>A</m> is equal to the number of leading ones in its RREF,
			and so for this <m>A</m> the rank is equal to the number of columns.
			But <m>A</m> is square,

			<p>
			If <m>A</m> is square,

			And if the rank of <m>A</m> is equal to its size,
			then every column in the RREF of <m>A</m> must have a leading one,
			and these leading ones must march down the diagonal of <m>A</m>.
			In a RREF matrix,
			a column that contains a leading one must have every other entry equal to zero.
			Thus, the RREF of <m>A</m> must be the identity matrix.

			That is, <m>A</m> can be reduced to <m>I</m> by some sequence of elementary row operations.
			Each of these operations has a corresponding elementary matrix,

				The elementary matrices need to be multiplied in reverse order because we apply the first row operation to <m>A</m> by multiplying <m>E_1A</m>,

			<p>
			Now, by <xref ref="lemma-elem-matrices-elem-inverse" />,

			Using this inverse,

				<mrow>A \amp = \inv{E}_1\inv{E}_2\dotsm \inv{E}_\ell.</mrow>
			</md>
			So, we have <m>A</m> expressed as a product of the <em>inverses</em> of a collection of elementary matrices.
			But by
			<xref ref="lemma-elem-matrices-elem-inverse" />,
			each of these inverses is actually an elementary matrix as well,

			</title>
			<p>
				If <m>A</m> is equal to a product of elementary matrices,

		<paragraphs><title>Conclusion</title><p>
			We now have a circle of logical deductions.
			Starting with the knowledge that any one of the seven statements is true for a particular matrix <m>A</m>,
			we can deduce from the logic above that the next statement is true for <m>A</m>,
			and then from that,
			that the next statement is true for <m>A</m>,
			and so on.
			When we get to the last statement,
			the logic above then requires that the first statement will also be true for <m>A</m>,
			and we can continue from there on to the second statement,
			and so on,
			until we are sure that <em>all</em> statements are true for <m>A</m>.
			Therefore, the seven statements are equivalent.

</theorem>

<remark><p><ul>
	<li>
		In this theorem,
		the claim that these seven statements are equivalent for a particular matrix <m>A</m> means that if we know that any <em>one</em> of the statements is true for <m>A</m>,
		then it must be that <em>all seven</em> statements are true for <m>A</m>.
		For example, if we had a square matrix that we were able to row reduce to the identity,
		then the theorem tells us that that matrix must be invertible,
		that every linear system with that matrix as coefficient matrix has one unique solution,
		and so on.
		On the other hand, if we know that any one of the statements is <em>false</em> for a particular matrix <m>A</m>,
		then it must be that <em>all seven</em> statements are <em>false</em> for <m>A</m>.
		As soon as one statement is known to be false for a particular square matrix,
		it becomes impossible for any of the other statements to be true for that matrix,
		since knowing that this other statement is true implies that <em>all seven</em> statements are true for it,
		including the original statement that we already knew was false.
		And a statement cannot be both true and false for a particular matrix <m>A</m>.

		tells us that when a matrix is invertible,

		But the reverse connection would be difficult to use in practice:
		would you want to check that <em>every</em> system with a particular square coefficient matrix has one unique solution in order to conclude that the matrix is invertible? There are infinity of possible systems to check!
		The equivalence of
		<xref ref="theorem-elem-matrices-equiv-to-invertible-some-sys">Statement</xref>
		and
		<xref ref="theorem-elem-matrices-equiv-to-invertible-invertible">Statement</xref>
		makes the reverse logic easier in practice:
		if you have just <em>one</em> example of a linear system with a square coefficient matrix that has one unique solution,
		then you can conclude that the matrix is invertible.
		Even better, the equivalence of
		<xref ref="theorem-elem-matrices-equiv-to-invertible-homog-sys">Statement</xref>
		and
		<xref ref="theorem-elem-matrices-equiv-to-invertible-invertible">Statement</xref>
		tells you that you can just check the corresponding <em>homogeneous</em> system as your one example of a system with that particular coefficient matrix that has only one unique solution.
		Furthermore, the equivalence of
		<xref ref="theorem-elem-matrices-equiv-to-invertible-every-sys">Statement</xref>
		and
		<xref ref="theorem-elem-matrices-equiv-to-invertible-some-sys">Statement</xref>
		tells you that once you know <em>one</em> example of a system with that particular coefficient matrix that has only one unique solution,

<subsection xml:id="subsection-elem-matrices-theory-more-inverses-props">
<title>More properties of inverses</title>

<p>
Using our new connections between inverses and row operations,
we can expand our knowledge about inverses in general.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-elem-matrices-check-only-left-inverse">

	<title> Left inverse is inverse </title>

	<statement><p>
		Suppose <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are square matrices of the same size such that <m>B A = I</m>.
		Then <m>A</m> is invertible with <m>\inv{A} = B</m>.
	</p></statement>

	<proof>
		<p>
		We are assuming that we have square matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> so that <m>B A = I</m>.
		We would first like to check that <m>A</m> is invertible.
		By
		<xref ref="theorem-elem-matrices-equiv-to-invertible" />,
		we can instead check that the homogeneous system
		<m>A \uvec{x} = \zerovec</m>
		has only the trivial solution.
		So suppose that <m>\uvec{x}_0</m> is a solution to this system,
		so that
		<m>A \uvec{x}_0 = \zerovec</m>.
		But then we can carry out two different simplifications of
		<m>B A \uvec{x}_0</m>,
		one using the assumption
		<m>B A = I</m>
		and one using the assumption
		<m>A \uvec{x}_0 = \zerovec</m>:
		<md>
			<mrow>
				B A \uvec{x}_0 \amp= (B A) \uvec{x}_0 \amp
				B A \uvec{x}_0 \amp= B (A \uvec{x}_0)
			</mrow><mrow>
				\amp= I\uvec{x}_0 \amp
				\amp= B \zerovec
			</mrow><mrow>
				\amp= \uvec{x}_0, \amp
				\amp= \zerovec.
			</mrow>
		</md>
		Since both simplifications are correct,
		we have
		<m>\uvec{x}_0 = \zerovec</m>.
		So what we have discovered is that because there exists a matrix <m>B</m> so that
		<m>B A = I</m>,
		then whenever we think we have a solution <m>\uvec{x}_0</m> to the system
		<m>A \uvec{x} = \zerovec</m>,
		that solution turns out to be the trivial solution.
		Thus,
		<m>A \uvec{x} = \zerovec</m>
		must have <em>only</em> the trivial solution,
		and hence <m>A</m> is invertible
		(<xref ref="theorem-elem-matrices-equiv-to-invertible" />).
		</p><p>
		Now that we know that <m>A</m> is invertible,
		we can use its inverse to manipulate the equality <m> B A = I</m>:
		<md>
			<mrow>B A \amp= I</mrow>
			<mrow>(B A) \inv{A} \amp= I \inv{A}</mrow>
			<mrow>B (A \inv{A}) \amp= \inv{A}</mrow>
			<mrow>B I \amp= \inv{A}</mrow>
			<mrow>B \amp= \inv{A}.</mrow>
		</md>
		So, we have that <m>A</m> is invertible and <m>\inv{A} = B</m>,
		as desired.
		</p>
	</proof>

</proposition>

<remark><p>
	Recall that by definition,
	to verify that a matrix <m>B</m> is the inverse of a matrix <m>A</m>,
	we would need to check that <em>both</em>
	<m>BA=I</m> <em>and</em> <m>AB=I</m> are true.
	We needed both orders of multiplication in the definition of <term>inverse matrix</term> because order of matrix multiplication matters,
	and we couldn't be sure that both <m>BA</m> and <m>AB</m> would produce the same result.
	Via the theory of elementary matrices,
	we now have the above proposition that allows us to check an inverse by <em>only</em> checking one order of multiplication:
	<m>BA=I</m>.
</p></remark>

<p>
There is nothing special about
<m>BA=I</m> versus <m>AB=I</m>.
The previous and following propositions combine to tell us we only need to verify <em>only one</em> of <m>BA=I</m> or <m>AB=I</m> to check that <m>B</m> is the inverse of <m>A</m>.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-elem-matrices-check-only-right-inverse">

	<title> Right inverse is inverse </title>

		Here, we are assuming that we have square matrices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> so that

<p>
In
<xref ref="proposition-inverses-props-of-inverses" />,
we learned that products and powers of invertible matrices are always invertible.
It turns out that a product of matrices can <em>only</em> be invertible if the matrices making up the product are all invertible,
and a power of a matrix can <em>only</em> be invertible if the base matrix is invertible.

matrices.

<title>Solution sets of row equivalent matrices</title>

<p>
Elementary matrices also give us the tool we need to prove that row equivalent matrices represent systems with the same solution set.
We first recorded the following as
<xref ref="theorem-row-red-row-equiv-same-sol-set" />
in
<xref ref="subsection-row-red-theory-solving" />,
but did not prove it there.
We repeat the theorem here, and include a proof.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-elem-matrices-row-equiv-same-sol-set">

	<statement><p> Row equivalent matrices represent systems of equations that have the same solution set. </p></statement>

	<proof>

		<p>
		Consider systems
		<m>A_1\uvec{x} = \uvec{b}_1</m>
		and
		<m>A_2\uvec{x} = \uvec{b}_2</m>,
		where augmented matrices
		<md><mrow>
			A_1' \amp= \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A_1 \amp \uvec{b}_1 \end{array}\right],
			\amp
			A_2' \amp= \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A_2 \amp \uvec{b}_2 \end{array}\right]
		</mrow></md>
		are row equivalent.
		Then there exists a sequence of elementary row operations that can be applied to <m>A_1'</m> to produce <m>A_2'</m>.
		If we set <m>E</m> to be the <em>product</em> of all the elementary matrices corresponding to the operations in this sequence,
		then we have <m>A_2' = EA_1'</m>.
		Because of the way matrix multiplication acts on columns,
		we then have
		<me>
			\left[\begin{array}{c|c} A_2 \amp \uvec{b}_2 \end{array}\right]
			= E \left[\begin{array}{c|c} A_1 \amp \uvec{b}_1 \end{array}\right]
			= \left[\begin{array}{c|c} EA_1 \amp E\uvec{b}_1 \end{array}\right],
		</me>
		and so we also have
		<md><mrow> A_2 \amp= EA_1, \amp \uvec{b}_2 \amp= E\uvec{b}_1. </mrow></md>
		Furthermore, we know that every elementary matrix is invertible
		(<xref ref="lemma-elem-matrices-elem-inverse" />),
		and that products of invertible matrices are invertible
		(<xref ref="proposition-inverses-props-of-inverses-inverse-extended-product">Statement</xref>
		of
		<xref ref="proposition-inverses-props-of-inverses" />),
		so we conclude that <m>E</m> is invertible.
		Therefore, we also have
		<md><mrow> A_1 \amp= \inv{E}A_2, \amp \uvec{b}_1 \amp= \inv{E}\uvec{b}_2. </mrow></md>
		</p>

		<p> We are now in a position to verify that a solution to one system is also a solution to the other system. </p>
