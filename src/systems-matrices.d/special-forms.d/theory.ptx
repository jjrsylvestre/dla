<introduction><p>
	Here we record properties of these special forms of matrices relative to the various matrix operations.
</p></introduction>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-special-forms-theory-algebra">
<title>Algebra of special forms</title>

<p>
First, we summarize some of the algebra of working with these forms.
We have already explored proving parts of the proposition below
in <xref ref="activity-special-forms-prove-sum-diagonal" />
and <xref ref="activity-special-forms-prove-sum-symmetric" />,
so below we provide similar proofs for a couple more parts.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-special-forms-combinations">
	<!-- old label: \labelprop{special.combinations.of.special.forms} -->

	<statement><p><ol>
		<li xml:id="proposition-special-forms-combinations-diag"><p>
			The result of adding two diagonal matrices, scalar multiplying a diagonal matrix, multiplying two diagonal matrices, taking an inverse of a diagonal matrix, or taking a power (positive or negative) of a diagonal matrix is always a diagonal matrix.

				<li> when all occurrences of the word <q>diagonal</q> are replaced by <q>upper triangular,</q> or </li>
				<li> when all occurrences of <q>diagonal</q> are replaced by <q>lower triangular.</q> </li>
			</ul>
		</p></li>
		<li xml:id="proposition-special-forms-combinations-symm">
			<xref ref="proposition-special-forms-combinations-diag">Statement</xref>
			remains true when all occurrences of the word <q>diagonal</q> are replaced by <q>symmetric,</q>
			<em>except</em> that the product of two symmetric matrices may not be symmetric.
		</li>
	</ol></p></statement>

	<proof>
		<title>Partial proof of <xref ref="proposition-special-forms-combinations-scalar-upper-lower">Statement</xref></title>
		<p>
		We will prove that the result of scalar multiplying an upper triangular matrix is again upper triangular.
		As we discovered in <xref ref="activity-special-forms-exploring-ij-entries">Discovery</xref>,
		an upper triangular matrix <m>U</m> is characterized by having all entries <m>u_{ij}</m> equal to <m>0</m> for <m>i>j</m>
		(<ie /> entries below the main diagonal).
		The scalar multiple <m>kU</m> has entries <m>[kU]_{ij} = ku_{ij}</m>,
		so if <m>u_{ij} = 0</m> for <m>i>j</m>,
		then also <m>k u_{ij} = 0</m> for <m>i>j</m>,
		and the matrix <m>kU</m> is also upper triangular.
		</p>
	</proof>

	<proof>
		<title>Partial proof of <xref ref="proposition-special-forms-combinations-symm">Statement</xref></title>
		<p>
		We will prove that the inverse of an invertible, symmetric matrix is again symmetric.
		So suppose that <m>A</m> is both invertible and symmetric.
		By definition of symmetry, this means that <m>A</m> is equal to its own transpose.
		We would like to verify that <m>\inv{A}</m> is also symmetric;
		that is, that <m>\inv{A}</m> is equal to its own transpose.
		Let's do that, using proper LHS vs RHS procedure for the proposed equality <m>\utrans{(\inv{A})} = \inv{A}</m>:
		<md>
			<mrow>\text{LHS} \amp = \utrans{(\inv{A})}</mrow>
			<mrow>\amp = \inv{(\utrans{A})} \amp \amp\text{(i)}</mrow>
			<mrow>\amp= \inv{(A)} \amp \amp\text{(ii)}</mrow>
			<mrow>\amp= \text{RHS},</mrow>
		</md>
		with justifications
		<ol marker="(i)">
			<li><xref ref="proposition-inverses-transpose" />; and</li>
			<li><m>\utrans{A}=A</m> by symmetric assumption.</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
	</proof>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-special-forms-theory-invertibility">
<title>Invertibility of special forms</title>

<p>
Finally, we record our observations about the invertibility of some of these special forms.
The following fact was already discussed in <xref ref="subsection-special-forms-concepts-inverses" />,
so we will not formally prove it.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="proposition-special-forms-invertibility">
	<statement><p>
		An upper or lower triangular matrix is invertible precisely when the entries on its main diagonal are all nonzero.
	</p></statement>
</proposition>

<aside><title>Special case</title><p>
	Since scalar and diagonal matrices are just particular forms of triangular matrix, 
	<xref ref="proposition-special-forms-invertibility" /> applies to scalar and diagonal matrices as well.
