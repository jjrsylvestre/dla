	<introduction>
		<p>
			Carry out the following tasks for <em>each</em> of the special types of matrices defined above.
			Think in general, and consider <em>every</em> possible size of matrix,
			not just <m>2\times 2</m> and <m>3\times 3</m>!
			You don't need to <em>prove</em> each answer,
			but you should be able to articulate an informal justification for each answer that doesn't rely on examples
			(unless it's a <em>counter</em>example).
		</p>
		<paragraphs><title>Tip</title><p>
			When considering the questions in this activity for <em>symmetric</em> matrices,
			rather than trying to figure things out with examples,
			it is much easier to work algebraically with a letter <m>A</m> representing an arbitrary symmetric matrix,
			and use the definition of symmetric: <m>\utrans{A} = A</m>.
		</p></paragraphs>
	</introduction>
	<task><p>
		Write down both a <m>2\times 2</m> and a <m>3\times 3</m> example of the type.
		Is it clear why this type of matrix has been given its particular name?
	</p></task>
	<task><p>
		Does the (square) zero matrix have this type?
		Does an identity matrix?
		Does every <m>1\times 1</m>?
	</p></task>
	<task><p>
		If <m>A</m> is a matrix of this type, is every scalar multiple of <m>A</m> also of this type?
		Is <m>\utrans{A}</m> of this type?
	</p></task>
	<task><p>
		If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are matrices of this type and of the same size, is their sum of this type?
		Their product?
		A power (with a positive exponent)?
	</p></task>
	<task xml:id="activity-special-forms-exploring-invertible-criterion">
		<p><em>[Omit this task for symmetric matrices.]</em></p>
		<p>
		Recall that a matrix is invertible if and only if its RREF is the identity matrix.
		Based on this, can you come up with a simple condition by which you can determine whether a matrix of this type is invertible or not?
		</p>
	</task>
	<task xml:id="activity-special-forms-exploring-inverse">
		<statement><p> If <m>A</m> is an invertible matrix of this type, is its inverse also of this type? </p></statement>
		<hint><title>for symmetric matrices</title><p>
			For the case of symmetric matrices, it will be too complicated to work by examples. Instead, consider the formula <m>\utrans{(\inv{A})} = \inv{(\utrans{A})}</m> from <xref ref="proposition-inverses-transpose" /> and the definition of <term>symmetric matrix</term> above.
		</p></hint>
	</task>
	<task xml:id="activity-special-forms-exploring-ij-entries">
		<statement><p>
			Come up with a condition or set of conditions on the entries <m>a_{ij}</m> of a square matrix <m>A</m> by which you can determine whether or not <m>A</m> is of this type.
		</p></statement>
		<hint><p>
			Here is an example of the type of condition we're looking for,
			using the identity matrix: a square matrix <m>A</m> is equal to the identity matrix if <m>a_{ii} = 1</m> for all indices <m>i</m>,
			and <m>a_{ij} = 0</m> for all pairs of indices <m>i,j</m> with <m>i\neq j</m>.

		This activity will guide you through proving that the sum of two symmetric matrices is again symmetric.
