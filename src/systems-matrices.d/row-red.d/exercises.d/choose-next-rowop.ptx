<title>Choosing row operations</title>

<introduction><p>
	For each matrix,
	choose a single row operation that makes incremental progress according to <xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref" />.
</p></introduction>

<exercise>
	<statement><p><m>\displaystyle
		\begin{amatrix}{rrrrr}

		The leftmost column that is not all zeros is the first column,
		so the immediate goal here should be to obtain a leading one in the first column
		(<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref-first-leading-one-obtain">Step</xref> of
		<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref" />).
		Any <em>one</em> of the operations <m>\frac{1}{6} R_1</m>, <m>\frac{1}{3} R_2</m>, <m>\frac{1}{2} R_3</m>, or <m>R_2 - R_3</m> may be employed to do so.
		However, it is usually preferable (though not necessary) to avoid introducing fractions in the matrix,
		so <m>R_2 - R_3</m> may be the best choice:
		<me>
			\begin{amatrix}{rrrrr}
				6 \amp -2 \amp  7 \amp  0 \amp  3 \\
				3 \amp  1 \amp  2 \amp  6 \amp  9 \\

		The leftmost column that is not all zeros is the first column,

		(<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref-first-leading-one-move">Step</xref> of

		Therefore, our choice of operation should be <m>R_1 \leftrightarrow R_3</m>:

				-3 \amp -2 \amp -1 \amp  4 \\

			\begin{amatrix}{rrrr}

		The leftmost column that is not all zeros is the first column,
		but we already have a leading one in the first column,
		and that leading one is already in the first row.
		So the immediate goal should be to use that leading one to eliminate the other non-zero entries in the first column
		(<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref-first-leading-one-elim">Step</xref> of
		<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref" />).
		Focusing on the <m>5</m> in the first column,
		combining it with <m>-5</m> times the leading one will cancel to zero.
		So our choice of operation should be <m>R_3 - 5 R_1</m>:
		<me>
			\begin{amatrix}{rrrrr}
				 1 \amp -4 \amp  1 \amp  4 \amp  4 \\
				 0 \amp -2 \amp  0 \amp -2 \amp  0 \\
				 5 \amp -5 \amp  8 \amp  4 \amp -8 \\
				-3 \amp  2 \amp -4 \amp -4 \amp  5
			\end{amatrix}
			\xrightarrow{R_3 - 5 R_1}
			\begin{amatrix}{rrrrr}
				 1 \amp -4 \amp  1 \amp   4 \amp   4 \\
				 0 \amp -2 \amp  0 \amp - 2 \amp   0 \\
				 0 \amp 15 \amp  3 \amp -16 \amp -28 \\
				-3 \amp  2 \amp -4 \amp - 4 \amp   5
			\end{amatrix}
		</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
		<alert>Note:</alert>
		It is acceptable (and advisable!) to combine multiple operations in one calculation step when carrying out an <q>elimination</q> step in <xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref" />
		(in this case,
		<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref-first-leading-one-elim">Step</xref>).
		That is,
		normally we would simultaneously perform our chosen operation <m>R_3 - 5 R_1</m> as well as the operation <m>R_4 + 3 R_1</m> in order to eliminate both of the other non-zero entries in the first column.

		This matrix already exhibits all the goals of
		<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref-first-leading-one">Step</xref>
		of <xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref" />,
		so we move on to <xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref-second-leading-one">Step</xref>.
		Ignoring the first row completely,
		the leftmost column that is not all zeros is the second column,
		and so the immediate goal should be to obtain a leading one in that column
		(<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref-second-leading-one-obtain">Step</xref> of
		<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref" />).
		We can do so using either operation <m>\frac{1}{3} R_2</m> or operation <m>-\frac{1}{6} R_3</m>.
		Since <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> is a simpler fraction and creates the leading one in the second row instead of the third,
		we'll choose that option:
		<me>
			\begin{amatrix}{rrrr}
				1 \amp -2 \amp -3 \amp 9 \\
				0 \amp  3 \amp  7 \amp 1 \\
				0 \amp -6 \amp  7 \amp 4
			\end{amatrix}
			\xrightarrow{\frac{1}{3} R_2}
			\begin{amatrix}{rrrr}
				1 \amp -2 \amp     -3      \amp      9      \\
				0 \amp  1 \amp \frac{7}{3} \amp \frac{1}{3} \\
				0 \amp -6 \amp      7      \amp      4
			\end{amatrix}
		</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
		<alert>Warning.</alert>
		It may be tempting to attempt to avoid fractions altogether by using the <m>-2</m> above that leading <m>3</m> to obtain the leading one.
		But notice what happens if we instead choose operation <m>R_2 + R_1</m>:
		<me>
			\begin{amatrix}{rrrr}
				1 \amp -2 \amp -3 \amp 9 \\
				0 \amp  3 \amp  7 \amp 1 \\
				0 \amp -6 \amp  7 \amp 4
			\end{amatrix}
			\xrightarrow{R_2 + R_1}
			\begin{amatrix}{rrrr}
				1 \amp -2 \amp -3 \amp  9 \\
				1 \amp  1 \amp  4 \amp 10 \\
				0 \amp -6 \amp  7 \amp  4
			\end{amatrix}
		</me>.
		Our goal was to obtain a leading one in the second column.
		While we have succeeded in obtaining a one in the second column,
		it is not a <em>leading</em> one,
		because a row operation must be carried through the <em>entire row</em>,
		including any <q>leading</q> zeros.
		The operation <m>R_2 + R_1</m> would reverse progress already made in reducing this matrix:
		in particular,
		it reverses the progress of
		<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref-first-leading-one-elim">Step</xref> of
		<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref" />
		by <q>un-eliminating</q> an entry in the first column below that leftmost leading one.
		It is precisely for this reason that
		<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref-second-leading-one-obtain">Step</xref> of
		<xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref" />
		advises <em>not</em> to use the first row to attempt to obtain a second leading one.
