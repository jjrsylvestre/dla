<title>Identifying leading/constrained/free variables</title>

<introduction>

	<p>
	Assume that each matrix below represents the augmented matrix of a linear system of equations in the variables <m>x_1,x_2,\dotsc,x_n</m>
	(where <m>n</m> is the number of variable columns in the matrix).
	</p>

	<p>
	For each matrix,
	identify the <term><xref ref="definition-row-red-leading-var" text="title" /></term>.
	Then decide which variables are <term><xref ref="definition-row-red-free-var" text="custom">free</xref></term> and which are constrained.
	</p>

</introduction>

<exercise>
	<statement><p><m>\displaystyle
		\begin{amatrix}{rr|r}
			0 \amp 5 \amp  9 \\
			8 \amp 9 \amp -2
		\end{amatrix}
	</m></p></statement>
	<answer><p>
		Both variables <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are leading:
		<me>
			\begin{amatrix}{rr|r}
				{\color{red} 0} \amp \boxed{5} \amp  9 \\
				   \boxed{8}    \amp     9     \amp -2
			\end{amatrix}
		</me>.
		The boxed entries could be converted into leading ones through row operations.
		Therefore, both variables are constrained and there are no free variables.
		(This implies the underlying system has one unique solution.)
	</p></answer>
</exercise>

<exercise>
	<statement><p><m>\displaystyle
		\begin{amatrix}{rrr|r}
			7 \amp -3 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
			0 \amp  0 \amp 5 \amp 8
		\end{amatrix}
	</m></p></statement>
	<answer><p>
		Variables <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_3</m> are leading:
		<me>
			\begin{amatrix}{rrr|r}
				   \boxed{7}    \amp        -3       \amp     1     \amp 4 \\
				{\color{red} 0} \amp {\color{red} 0} \amp \boxed{5} \amp 8
			\end{amatrix}
		</me>.
		The boxed entries could be converted into leading ones through row operations.
		These two variables are constrained by the respective equations in which they are the leading variables,
		which leaves <m>x_2</m> as a free variable.
		(This implies the underlying system has an infinite number of solutions.)

	<answer><p>
		Variables <m>x_2,x_4,x_5</m> are leading:
		<me>
			\begin{amatrix}{rrrrr|r}
				{\color{red} 0} \amp {\color{red} 0} \amp {\color{red} 0} \amp  {\color{red} 0} \amp    \boxed{8}    \amp        5        \\
				{\color{red} 0} \amp {\color{red} 0} \amp {\color{red} 0} \amp  {\color{red} 0} \amp {\color{red} 0} \amp {\color{red} 0} \\
				{\color{red} 0} \amp    \boxed{1}    \amp        0        \amp         3        \amp        0        \amp        0        \\
				{\color{red} 0} \amp {\color{red} 0} \amp {\color{red} 0} \amp     \boxed{-4}   \amp       -4        \amp       -7
			\end{amatrix}
		</me>.
		Variable <m>x_2</m> already has a leading one in its column,
		and the other two boxed entries could be converted into leading ones through row operations.
		These three variables are constrained by the respective equations in which they are the leading variables,
		which leaves <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_3</m> as free variables.
		(This implies the underlying system has an infinite number of solutions.)
