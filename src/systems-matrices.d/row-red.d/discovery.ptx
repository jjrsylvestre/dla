<activity><p>
	In a homogeneous system, what is the relationship between the number of variables,
	the number of <q>leading ones</q> in the most reduced form of the coefficient matrix,
	and the number of parameters required to solve the system?
	What pattern of leading ones in a completely reduced coefficient matrix tells you that the corresponding homogeneous system has a single, unique solution?
</p></activity>

<activity>

	<p>
	Consider system
	<me>
		\begin{sysofeqns}{rcrcrcrcrcr}
			3 x_1 \amp - \amp   x_2 \amp + \amp 4 x_3 \amp = \amp b_1 \\
			  x_1 \amp + \amp 2 x_2 \amp - \amp   x_3 \amp = \amp b_2 \\
			3 x_1 \amp   \amp       \amp + \amp 3 x_3 \amp = \amp b_3
		\end{sysofeqns}
	</me>
	where the constants of each equation are not specified.
	For what values of the unknown constants <m>b_1,b_2,b_3</m> is this system consistent?
	</p><p>
	To answer this question,
	row reduce the associated augmented matrix (below) until you are at a point where you can determine conditions on the constants <m>b_1,b_2,b_3</m> that ensures the system is consistent.
	<me>
		\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
			3 \amp -1 \amp 4 \amp b_1\\1 \amp 2 \amp -1 \amp b_2\\3 \amp 0 \amp 3 \amp b_3
		\end{array}\right].
	</me>
	</p>

	<aside><title>A look ahead</title><p>
		By the end of <xref ref="chapter-col-row-null-space" />,
		we will have developed much more sophisticated theory that will allow us to express a uniform <em>condition for consistency</em> for coefficient matrices versus the associated collection of equation constants.
