	<title>Patterns of RREF</title>

	<task><p>
		Determine all possible matrices that have two rows, two columns, and are in RREF.
		(In your example matrices,
		every entry will be one of
		<em>must be one</em>
		or
		<em>must be zero</em>
		or
		<em>could be any value</em>.
		Write an asterisk <m>\ast</m> for entries that <em>could be any value</em>.)
	</p></task>

	<task><p>
		Determine all possible matrices that have three rows, three columns, and are in RREF.
	</p></task>

	<task><p>
		Without writing all the possibilities down,
		can you determine <em>how many</em> different possible forms of RREF matrix with four rows and four columns there are?
	</p></task>

	<task><p>
		Based on your answers so far,
		can you come up with a pattern for the number of different possible forms of RREF matrix with <m>n</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns?
		How does the pattern change for matrices with more rows than columns?
		Or for matrices with fewer rows than columns?

	<title>Existence of a unique solution for two variables</title>

	<task xml:id="exercise-row-red-2var-unique-sol-condition-algebra"><p>
		Suppose <m>a, b, c, d</m> are constant values so that <m>a d - b c</m> is <em>not</em> equal to zero.
		Use <xref ref="proposition-row-red-sys-sol-type-conditions" /> to demonstrate that every system that has coefficient matrix

		has one unique solution.
	</p></task>

	<task>
		<introduction><p>
			Now consider the geometric interpretation of <xref ref="exercise-row-red-2var-unique-sol-condition-algebra" text="type-local" />.
			Suppose we have system of equations
			<me>
				\begin{sysofeqns}{rcrcr}
					a x \amp + \amp b y \amp = \amp k_1 \\
					c x \amp + \amp d y \amp = \amp k_2
				\end{sysofeqns}

		</p></introduction>

		<task><p>
			What are the slopes of the lines involved in the system?
			(For simplicity, assume both <m>b \neq 0</m> and <m>d \neq 0</m>.)

		<task xml:id="exercise-row-red-2var-unique-sol-condition-geometry-1"><p>
			Suppose the system has no solution.

		<task><p>
			The two cases of

			and
			<xref ref="exercise-row-red-2var-unique-sol-condition-geometry-2" text="type-local" />
			can be summarized into one case as <q><em>not</em> the case of a single unique solution.</q>
			In each of those two cases,
			what does the relationship between the slopes of the two lines imply about the value of <m>a d - b c</m>?

<exercise>
	<title>A special type of coefficient matrix</title>

	<p>
	A matrix is called <term>upper triangular</term> when it has the same number of columns as rows <em>and</em> its entries follow the pattern:
	<ul>
		<li>The first entry in the second row is zero.</li>
		<li>The first two entries in the third row are zero.</li>
		<li>The first three entries in the fourth row are zero.</li>
		<li>And so on.</li>
	</ul>
	For example, the matrices
	<md><mrow>
		\amp \begin{bmatrix} a \amp b \\ 0 \amp c \end{bmatrix} \amp
		\amp \begin{bmatrix} a \amp b \amp c \\ 0 \amp d \amp e \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp f \end{bmatrix} \amp
		\amp \begin{bmatrix} a \amp b \amp c \amp d \\ 0 \amp e \amp f \amp g \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp h \amp i \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp j \end{bmatrix}
	</mrow></md>
	are all upper triangular.
	</p>

	<aside><title>A look ahead</title><p>
		We will study this and other special forms of matrices further in <xref ref="chapter-special-forms" />.
	</p></aside>

	<p>
	Using <xref ref="proposition-row-red-sys-sol-type-conditions" /> for inspiration,
	determine a simple condition or set of conditions by which one can predict,
	<em>without</em> performing any row operations,
	whether a homogeneous system of equations with an upper triangular coefficient matrix will have one unique solution or will have an infinite number of solutions.
