<title>Reflect on your understanding</title>

<exercise>
	<title>Echelon forms</title>
	<p> Describe <term>row echelon form</term> and <term>reduced row echelon form</term> in your own words. </p>
</exercise>

<exercise>
	<title>Reducing matrices</title>
	<p> Write a simplified version of <xref ref="procedure-row-red-reduce-to-rref" /> in your own words. </p>
</exercise>

<exercise>
	<title>Determining the number of solutions</title>
	<p>
		Describe the different patterns in reduced augmented matrices that determine whether the associated system has
		no solution,
		one unique solution,
		or an infinite number of solutions.
		Further describe <em>why</em> each pattern tells the number of solutions (none/one/infinitely many).
	</p>
</exercise>

<exercise>
	<title>Number of solutions for a homogeneous systems</title>
	<task><p> Explain why it is true that every homogeneous system is consistent. </p></task>
	<task><p> Explain why a homogeneous system with fewer equations than variables must have at least one nontrivial solution. </p></task>
</exercise>

<exercise>
	<title>Rank versus parameters</title>

	<task><p>
		Describe the relationship between the rank of a matrix and the number of parameters required to express the general solution to the homogeneous system for which that matrix is the coefficient matrix.
	</p></task>

	<task><p>
		In particular,
		what must the rank of a matrix be for the corresponding homogeneous system to have only the trivial solution?
	</p></task>

</exercise>

<exercise>
	<title>Row equivalence to RREF</title>

	<task>

		<introduction><p>
			Suppose two students are given the same matrix to reduce,
			and they choose different sequences of row operations.
			Assume they perform all operations correctly,
			and both eventually arrive at a matrix in RREF.
		</p></introduction>

		<task><p>
			Even though they performed different sequences of operations,
			could their RREF results be the same as each other?
		</p></task>

		<task><p>
			Since they performed different sequences of operations,
			could their RREF results be different from each other?
		</p></task>

	</task>

	<task>

		<p>
		Suppose two students are given <em>different</em> matrices to reduce.
		Again assume they perform all operations correctly,
		and both eventually arrive at a matrix in RREF.
		</p>

		<p>
		Even though they started with different matrices,
		could their RREF results be the same as each other?
		</p>

	</task>
