<title>Guessing equation solutions</title>

<introduction><p> For each equation, determine four specific solutions. </p></introduction>

<exercise>
	<statement><p><m> 2 x + 3 y = 5 </m></p></statement>
	<solution>
		<p>
		There are no restrictions on the value of the <m>y</m> variable,
		so we may choose its value to be anything we like and then determine the corresponding <m>x</m>-value.
		For example,
		when <m>y = -1</m> we have
		<md>
			<mrow> 2 x + 3 \cdot (-1) \amp = 5 </mrow>
			<mrow> 2 x - 3 \amp = 5 </mrow>
			<mrow> 2 x \amp = 5 + 3 </mrow>
			<mrow> 2 x \amp = 8 </mrow>
			<mrow> x \amp = 4 </mrow>
		</md>.
		Thus <m>x = 4, y = -1</m> is a specific solution to the equation.
		Here is a list of that solution and three others obtained by choosing other values for <m>y</m> and then solving for the corresponding <m>x</m> value,
		just as above.
		<ol cols="2">
			<li><m>x = 4, y = -1</m></li>
			<li><m>x = 1, y = 1</m></li>
			<li><m>x = 5 / 2, y = 0</m></li>
			<li><m>x = 2, y = 1/3</m></li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<aside><title>Remark</title><p>
			There was no particular reasoning behind our choices of values for <m>y</m>,
			other than to keep the choices simple.
			Any real values could have been chosen.
		</p></aside>
	</solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
	<statement><p><m> 3 x - 4 y + z = -6 </m></p></statement>
	<solution>
		<p>
		There are no restrictions on the value of either the <m>y</m> or <m>z</m> variable <mdash />
		we may choose any combination of values for these two variables and then determine the corresponding <m>x</m>-value.
		For example,
		when <m>y = 1</m> and <m>z = 0</m> we have
		<md>
			<mrow> 3 x - 4 \cdot 1 + 0 \amp = -6 </mrow>
			<mrow> 3 x - 4 \amp = -6 </mrow>
			<mrow> 3 x \amp = -6 + 4 </mrow>
			<mrow> 3 x \amp = -2 </mrow>
			<mrow> x \amp = - 2 / 3 </mrow>
		</md>.
		Thus, <m>x = - 2 / 3, y = 1, z = 0</m> is a specific solution to the equation.
		Here is a list of that solution and three others obtained by choosing other combinations of values for <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> and then solving for the corresponding <m>x</m> value,
		just as above.
		<ol cols="2">
			<li><m>x = - 2 / 3, y = 1, z = 0</m></li>
			<li><m>x = -7 / 3, y = 0, z = 1</m></li>
			<li><m>x = -2, y = 0, z = 0</m></li>
			<li><m>x = -1, y = 1, z = 1</m></li>
		</ol>
		</p>
