<title>Row operations versus equation manipulations</title>

<p>
Let's examine the operations in <xref ref="activity-systems-towards-row-red" /> in detail,
by considering the operations as both <em>equation manipulations</em> and <em>row operations</em> simultaneously.
</p><p>
In each step, notice how the row<m>\leftrightarrow</m>equation and column<m>\leftrightarrow</m>variable correspondence is preserved.

Subtract <m>3</m> times the first row/equation from the second row/equation.
For the equation version,
we do this by performing the same combination of left- and right-hand sides,
collecting terms on the left.
<me>\begin{array}{ccccccc}
	(\text{LHS}_2) \amp - \amp 3(\text{LHS}_1) \amp = \amp (\text{RHS}_2) \amp - \amp 3(\text{RHS}_1) \\
	(3x + 3z) \amp - \amp 3(x-y+3z) \amp = \amp 9 \amp - \amp 3(2)
\end{array}</me>
This combination leads to new equation
<me> 0x + 3y - 6z = 3 </me>.
Notice that when collecting terms,
we ended up performing that
<q>subtract <m>3</m> times the first from the second</q>
on the coefficients of each variable.
So we can achieve the same result in the matrix by performing
<q>subtract <m>3</m> times the entry in the first row from the entry in the second row,</q>
one column at a time.
<md><mrow>
	\amp\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
		1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp 2 \\
		0 \amp 3 \amp -6 \amp 3 \\
		-2 \amp 2 \amp -5 \amp -1
	\end{array}\right]
	\amp
	\amp\left\{\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
		  x \amp - \amp  y \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp  2 \\
	        \amp   \amp 3y \amp - \amp 6z \amp = \amp  3 \\
		-2x \amp + \amp 2y \amp - \amp 5z \amp = \amp -1
	\end{array}\right.
</mrow></md>
Next, add <m>2</m> times the first row/equation to the third row/equation:
<me>
	\begin{array}{ccccccc}
		(\text{LHS}_3) \amp + \amp 2 (\text{LHS}_1) \amp = \amp (\text{RHS}_3) \amp + \amp 2 (\text{RHS}_1) \\
		(-2x+2y-5z) \amp + \amp 2 (x-y+3z) \amp = \amp -1 \amp + \amp 2(2),
	\end{array}
</me>
leading to new equation
<me> z = 3 </me>,
which we will use to replace the old third row/equation.
<md><mrow>
	\amp\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
		1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp 2 \\
		0 \amp 3 \amp -6 \amp 3 \\
		0 \amp 0 \amp  1 \amp 3
	\end{array}\right]
	\amp
	\amp\left\{\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
		 x  \amp - \amp  y \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp 2 \\
		    \amp   \amp 3y \amp - \amp 6z \amp = \amp 3 \\
		    \amp   \amp    \amp   \amp  z \amp = \amp 3
	\end{array}\right.
</mrow></md>
Finally, multiply the second row/equation by 1/3:
<me>
	\begin{array}{ccc}
		(1/3)(\text{LHS}_2) \amp = \amp (1/3)(\text{RHS}_2) \\
		(1/3)(3y-6z) \amp = \amp (1/3)(3) \\
		y - 2z \amp = \amp 1
	\end{array}
</me>,
and modify the matrix accordingly:
<md><mrow>
	\amp\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
		1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp 2 \\
		0 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp 1 \\
		0 \amp 0 \amp  1 \amp 3
	\end{array}\right]
	\amp
	\amp\left\{\begin{array}{rcrcrcr}
		 x  \amp - \amp  y \amp + \amp 3z \amp = \amp 2 \\
		    \amp   \amp  y \amp - \amp 2z \amp = \amp 1 \\
		    \amp   \amp    \amp   \amp  z \amp = \amp 3
	\end{array}\right.
</mrow></md>.
The final system on the right is much easier to solve:
we can see immediately from the third equation that <m>z=3</m>,
then can use this in the second equation to determine <m>y=7</m>,
and finally can use both of these in the first equation to determine <m>x=0</m>.

<paragraphs>
<title>A look ahead</title>
<p>
In
<xref ref="chapter-row-red" />,
we will develop a systematic method of simplifying a system in this manner, but working exclusively with augmented matrices.
Also, we will take the process a few steps further to make the system as simple as possible.
Notice how <q>back-solving</q> the system proceeds from bottom-right to top-left.
We will use the same process when solving systems using matrices.
