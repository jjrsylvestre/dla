	<p> Explain how to test whether a specific set of variable values is a solution to a system of equations. </p>
</exercise>

<exercise>
	<title>Representing system solutions</title>

</exercise>

<exercise>
	<title>Number of equations versus number of unknowns</title>

	<introduction><p>
		In your previous mathematical studies,
		you may have heard the <q>rule of thumb</q> that
		<em>to solve for <m>n</m> variables you need <m>n</m> equations</em>.
	</p></introduction>

	<task>
		<introduction><p>
			Use lines in the Cartesian plane to explore whether this <q>rule of thumb</q> is accurate for linear equations in two variables.
		</p></introduction>
		<task><p> Does a system of one linear equation in two unknowns have solutions? </p></task>
		<task><p> Does a system of two linear equation in two unknowns <em>always</em> have a solution? </p></task>
		<task><p> Can a system of three linear equations in two unknowns have a solution? </p></task>
	</task>

	<task>
		<introduction><p>
			Use planes in three-dimensional space to explore whether this <q>rule of thumb</q> is accurate for linear equations in three variables.
			(You may wish to use pieces of papers as props to represent different planes.)
		</p></introduction>
		<task><p> Does a system of one linear equation in three unknowns have solutions? </p></task>
		<task><p> Can a system of two linear equations in three unknowns have solutions? </p></task>
		<task><p> Does a system of three linear equations in three unknowns <em>always</em> have a solution? </p></task>
		<task><p> Can a system of four linear equations in three unknowns have a solution? </p></task>
	</task>

	<conclusion><p>
		Based on your reflections above,
		rewrite the <q>rule of thumb</q> to more accurately express the intended meaning.
	</p></conclusion>
