		<p>
			The graph of a linear equation in three variables

			corresponds to a plane in three-dimensional space.
		</p><p>
			Suppose you had <em>three</em> equations in three variables.
			Try to imagine the geometric configuration of the corresponding three planes in each of the following situations.
			You might find it helpful to use three pieces of paper as props.
