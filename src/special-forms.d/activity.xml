<introduction><p>
  Recall that the <term>main diagonal</term> of a square matrix refers to the entries on the diagonal from top left to bottom right. Here are some special types of <em>square</em> matrices for consideration.
  <dl>
    <li><title><term>scalar matrix</term></title><p>a scalar multiple of the identity matrix</p></li>
    <li><title><term>diagonal matrix</term></title><p>all entries <em>not</em> on the main diagonal are zero</p></li>
    <li><title><term>upper triangular matrix</term></title><p>all entries <em>below</em> the main diagonal are zero</p></li>
    <li><title><term>lower triangular matrix</term></title><p>all entries <em>above</em> the main diagonal are zero</p></li>
    <li><title><term>symmetric matrix</term></title><p>a matrix that is equal to its own transpose</p></li>
  </dl>
</p></introduction>

<activity xml:id="activity-special-forms-exploring">
  <statement>

    <p>Carry out the following tasks for <em>each</em> of the special types of matrices defined above. Think in general, and consider <em>every</em> possible size of matrix, not just <m>2\times 2</m> and <m>3\times 3</m>! You don't need to <em>prove</em> each answer, but you should be able to articulate an informal justification for each answer that doesn't rely on examples (unless it's a <em>counter</em>example).</p>

    <aside><title>Tip</title><p>
      When considering the questions in this activity for <em>symmetric</em> matrices, rather than trying to figure things out with examples, it is much easier to work algebraically with a letter <m>A</m> representing an arbitrary symmetric matrix, and use the definition of symmetric: <m>\utrans{A} = A</m>.

      <!-- TODO overlapping asides.... -->

  		<li>
      Write down both a <m>2\times 2</m> and a <m>3\times 3</m> example of the type.
  		Is it clear why this type of matrix has been given its particular name?
      </li>

  		<li>
      Does the (square) zero matrix have this type?
  		Does an identity matrix?
  		Does every <m>1\times 1</m>?
      </li>

  		<li>
      If <m>A</m> is a matrix of this type, is every scalar multiple of <m>A</m> also of this type?
  		Is <m>\utrans{A}</m> of this type?
      </li>

  		<li>
      If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are matrices of this type and of the same size, is their sum of this type?
      Their product? A power (with a positive exponent)?

  		<li xml:id="activity-special-forms-exploring-invertible-criterion">
  		<p><em>[Omit this task for symmetric matrices.]</em></p>
      <p>Recall that a matrix is invertible if and only if its RREF is the identity matrix. Based on this, can you come up with a simple condition by which you can determine whether a matrix of this type is invertible or not?</p>
      </li>

  		<li xml:id="activity-special-forms-exploring-inverse">
      <p>If <m>A</m> is an invertible matrix of this type, is its inverse also of this type?</p>
      <aside><title>Note</title><p>
      For the case of symmetric matrices in <xref ref="activity-special-forms-exploring-inverse">Part</xref>, it will be too complicated to work by examples. Instead, consider the formula <m>\utrans{(\inv{A})} = \inv{(\utrans{A})}</m> from <xref ref="proposition-inverses-transpose" /> and the definition of <term>symmetric matrix</term> above.

      <li xml:id="activity-special-forms-exploring-ij-entries">
  		<p>Come up with a condition or set of conditions on the entries <m>a_{ij}</m> of a square matrix <m>A</m> by which you can determine whether or not <m>A</m> is of this type.</p>
      <aside><title>Example</title><p>
      Here is an example of the type of condition we're looking for in <xref ref="activity-special-forms-exploring-ij-entries">Part</xref>, in the case of the identity matrix: a square matrix <m>A</m> is equal to the identity matrix if <m>a_{ii} = 1</m> for all indices <m>i</m>, and <m>a_{ij} = 0</m> for all pairs of indices <m>i,j</m> with <m>i\neq j</m>.

    <p>
    This activity will guide you through proving that the sum of two symmetric matrices is again symmetric. Unlike the proof in <xref ref="activity-special-forms-prove-sum-diagonal" />, we will not need to consider individual entries, since the definition of <term>symmetric matrix</term> does not refer to individual entries like the definition of <term>diagonal matrix</term> does.

  	Suppose that <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are symmetric matrices of the same size. (But do <em>not</em> assume that they have a particular size like <m>2\times 2</m> or <m>3\times 3</m> or <etc />)
