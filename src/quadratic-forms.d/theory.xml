<title>Theory</title>

<p>
The fact that a quadratic form can always be represented by a symmetric matrix allows us to state the following version of
<xref ref="theorem-orthog-unitary-diag-symmetric-is-orthog-diag" />.
</p>

<theorem><title>The principal axis theorem</title><p>
	Every quadratic form can be diagonalized to remove cross terms by an appropriate orthogonal change of variables.
</p></theorem>

<p>
In the two-variable case,
we can also be specific about when a level set of a quadratic form corresponds to an ellipse in the plane,
and when it corresponds to a hyperbola.
</p>
<aside><title>Note</title><p>
	A level set of a quadratic form can also correspond to a circle,
	but a circle is just a special kind of ellipse,
	just as a square is a special kind of rectangle.

<theorem xml:id="theorem-quadratic-forms-2D-principal-axes">
	<title>The principal axis theorem for quadratic forms in two variables</title>
	<statement><p>
		Consider the quadratic form <m> q_A(\uvec{x}) = \utrans{\uvec{x}} A \uvec{x} </m>
		represented by symmetric matrix <m>A</m>.
		<ol>
			<li> There exists a rotation in the plane that transforms <m>q</m> into a diagonal form. </li>
			<li>
				The graph of <m>q(\uvec{x}) = 1</m> is an ellipse if <m>A</m> has two positive eigenvalues,
				is a hyperbola if <m>A</m> has one positive and one negative eigenvalue,
				and does not exist if <m>A</m> has two negative eigenvalues.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p></statement>
	<proof><title>Proof idea</title><p><ol>
		<li>
			We know that there exists a <m>2 \times 2</m> orthogonal matrix <m>P</m> so that <m>\utrans{P} A P</m> is diagonal,
			and a change of variables <m>\uvec{x} = P \uvec{w}</m> will diagonalize <m>q_A</m>,
			so that
			<me> q_A(\uvec{x}) = q_{\inv{P} A P} (\uvec{w}) </me>.
			The first column of <m>P</m> is a unit vector,
			so it must point from the origin to a point on the unit circle:
			<me> \uvec{p}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta \\ \sin \theta \end{bmatrix} </me>.
			As discussed in <xref ref="remark-quadratic-forms-examples-2x2-choosing-second-evector" />,
			the second eigenvector must be orthogonal to the first,
			so we can choose <m>\uvec{p}_2</m> to be either of
			<me>
				\left[\begin{array}{r} - \sin \theta \\ \cos \theta \end{array}\right] \text{,}
				\qquad
				\left[\begin{array}{r} \sin \theta \\ - \cos \theta \end{array}\right]
			</me>.
			Both of these vectors are unit vectors and are orthogonal to <m>\uvec{p}_1</m>.
			Also, eigenspaces are subspaces,
			and subspaces are closed under taking negatives,
			so it doesn't matter which one of the two options above we choose.
			If we choose the first option for <m>\uvec{p}_2</m>,
			we get rotation matrix
			<me> P = \left[\begin{array}{r} \cos \theta \amp - \sin \theta \\ \sin \theta \amp \cos \theta \end{array}\right] </me>.
		</li>
		<li>
			This statement should be obvious from the fact that the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> will be the coefficients in the diagonalized quadratic form.
		</li>
	</ol></p></proof>
