<title>Moving past triangular block form</title>

<p>
In <xref ref="activity-elem-nilpotent-moving-past-triang-block" />,
we first reminded ourselves that similarity is <term>transitive</term>,
and applied this fact with triangular block form as an intermediate form:
if a matrix is similar to a triangular block matrix,
and that triangular block matrix is similar to another (hopefully simpler) matrix,
then the first matrix is also similar to the third matrix.
So in our quest to determine a uniform answer to
<xref ref="question-block-diag-motivation-similarity-class-reps" />,
we can attempt to move past triangular block form by concentrating on that form itself.
</p><p>
As in <xref ref="activity-elem-nilpotent-moving-past-triang-block" />,
consider triangular block form matrix
<me> T = \begin{bmatrix} T_1 \\ \amp T_2 \\ \amp \amp \ddots \\ \amp \amp \amp T_\ell \end{bmatrix} </me>,
where each block <m>T_j</m> is a scalar-triangular form.
We would like to construct a transition matrix <m>Q</m> so that <m>\inv{Q} T Q</m> is somehow even simpler in form than <m>T</m>.
There are aspects of triangular block form that make it particularly simple,
and we don't want to mess those up.
But if we restrict ourselves to working with transition matrices
<me> Q = \begin{bmatrix} Q_1 \\ \amp Q_2 \\ \amp \amp \ddots \\ \amp \amp \amp Q_\ell \end{bmatrix} </me>
that are also in block-diagonal form,
with the same number and sizes of blocks as <m>T</m>,
then the algebra of block-diagonal matrices
(<xref ref="proposition-block-diag-props-products-powers">Statement</xref>
of <xref ref="proposition-block-diag-props" />)
tells us that
<me> \inv{Q} T Q = \begin{bmatrix} \inv{Q}_1 T_1 Q_1 \\ \amp \inv{Q}_2 T_2 Q_2 \\ \amp \amp \ddots \\ \amp \amp \amp \inv{Q}_\ell T_\ell Q_\ell \end{bmatrix} </me>.
So instead of focusing on how to make triangular block form simpler,
we can focus on how to make each scalar-triangular block simpler.
</p><p>
A scalar-triangular matrix <m>S</m> can be decomposed as a sum of a scalar matrix and an upper triangular matrix,
<me> S = \lambda I + N </me>,
where the upper triangular matrix has zeros down the diagonal.
(See <xref ref="equation-cayley-hamilton-scalar-triang-decomp" />
in <xref ref="subsection-cayley-hamilton-concepts-nilpotent" />.)
If <m>Q</m> is any transition matrix,
then
<me> \inv{Q} S Q = \inv{Q} (\lambda I + N) Q = \lambda \inv{Q} I Q + \inv{Q} N Q = \lambda I + \inv{Q} N Q </me>,
so again we can narrow our focus onto how to make matrices of the form of <m>N</m> simpler through similarity.
And since an upper triangular matrix of this form is always nilpotent
(<xref ref="lemma-cayley-hamilton-scalar-triang-nilpotent" />),
we should turn our attention to the similarity patterns of nilpotent matrices.
</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-elem-nilpotent-concepts-similarity">
<title>The similarity pattern of elementary nilpotent form</title>

<p>
As uncovered in <xref ref="activity-elem-nilpotent-similar-to-nilpotent" />,
nilpotent matrices can only be similar to other nilpotent matrices.
And as discussed in <xref ref="section-elem-nilpotent-motivation" />,
it might be fruitful to first examine the case of nilpotent matrices that are similar to
<term><xref ref="definition-elem-nilpotent-form" text="title" /></term>.
</p>
<aside><title>Triangular switch</title><p>
	Here we are switching from an upper triangular form to a lower triangular form so that the pattern we are about to uncover is more obvious.
</p></aside>
<p>
We'll follow the example of <xref ref="activity-elem-nilpotent-transition-col-pattern" />
and consider the <m>4 \times 4</m> case.
Suppose that <m>A</m> is similar to
<me> N = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \end{bmatrix} </me>.
Using <xref ref="pattern-similarity-concepts-similarity-by-columns" />,
we know that <m>\inv{P} A P = N</m> can only be true if
<md>
	<mrow>
		A\uvec{p}_1 \amp = 0\uvec{p}_1 + 1 \uvec{p}_2 + 0\uvec{p}_3 + 0\uvec{p}_4 \text{,}
	</mrow><mrow>
		A\uvec{p}_2 \amp = 0\uvec{p}_1 + 0 \uvec{p}_2 + 1\uvec{p}_3 + 0\uvec{p}_4 \text{,}
	</mrow><mrow>
		A\uvec{p}_3 \amp = 0\uvec{p}_1 + 0\uvec{p}_2 + 0\uvec{p}_3 + 1\uvec{p}_4 \text{,}
	</mrow><mrow>
		A\uvec{p}_4 \amp = 0\uvec{p}_1 + 0\uvec{p}_2 + 0\uvec{p}_3 + 0\uvec{p}_4 \text{,}
	</mrow>
</md>
where the <m>\uvec{p}_j</m> are the columns of <m>P</m>, as usual.
Rewriting this to make it a little more clear, we have
<md>
	<mrow>
		A\uvec{p}_1 \amp = \uvec{p}_2 \text{,}
	</mrow><mrow>
		A\uvec{p}_2 \amp = \uvec{p}_3 \text{,}
	</mrow><mrow>
		A\uvec{p}_3 \amp = \uvec{p}_4 \text{,}
	</mrow><mrow>
		A\uvec{p}_4 \amp = \zerovec \text{.}
	</mrow>
</md>
The effect of multiplication by <m>A</m> on the columns of <m>P</m> seems to follow a cyclic pattern,
though the pattern ends in the zero vector instead of wrapping back around to <m>\uvec{p}_1</m>.
This pattern becomes more evident if we repeatedly apply <m>A</m> to <m>\uvec{p}_1</m>.
<md>
	<mrow>
		A \uvec{p}_1 \amp = \uvec{p}_2 \text{,}
	</mrow><mrow>
		A^2 \uvec{p}_1 \amp = A(A\uvec{p}_1) = A\uvec{p}_2 = \uvec{p}_3 \text{,}
	</mrow><mrow>
		A^3 \uvec{p}_1 \amp = A(A^2\uvec{p}_1) = A\uvec{p}_3 = \uvec{p}_4 \text{,}
	</mrow><mrow>
		A^4 \uvec{p}_1 \amp = A(A^3\uvec{p}_1) = A\uvec{p}_4 = \zerovec \text{.}
	</mrow>
</md>
Of course, the pattern ended at <m>A^4 \uvec{p}_1 = \zerovec</m> because <m>A</m> is <m>4 \times 4</m> nilpotent
(<xref ref="corollary-cayley-hamilton-max-nilpotency" />).
</p><p>
It should be clear that the pattern will unfold in a similar manner for an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> that is similar to an elementary nilpotent form matrix.
</p>

<convention xml:id="pattern-elem-nilpotent-concepts-similarity">
	<title>Similarity with an elementary nilpotent matrix</title>
	<p>
	For <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> to be similar to an elementary nilpotent matrix <m>N</m> via similarity relation <m>\inv{P} A P</m>,
	the columns <m>\uvec{p}_1,\uvec{p}_2,\dotsc,\uvec{p}_n</m> of the transition matrix <m>P</m> must satisfy the pattern
	<me> \uvec{p}_{j+1} = A \uvec{p}_j = A^j \uvec{p}_1 </me>.
	</p>
</convention>

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsection-elem-nilpotent-concepts-proc">
<title>Elementary nilpotent procedure</title>

<p>
According to <xref ref="pattern-elem-nilpotent-concepts-similarity" />,
choosing the first column <m>\uvec{p}_1</m> of a transition matrix <m>P</m> automatically chooses all the other columns by
<me> \uvec{p}_{j+1} = A^j \uvec{p}_1 </me>.
However, none of the columns of <m>P</m> may be zero,
since we need <m>P</m> to be invertible.
In particular, we need
<md><mrow xml:id="equation-elem-nilpotent-concepts-transition-pattern" tag="star">
	\uvec{p}_n = A^{n-1} \uvec{p}_1 \ne \zerovec
</mrow></md>.
So while <m>A</m> must be nilpotent in order to be similar to a nilpotent matrix,
and so will satisfy <m>A^n = \zerovec</m>
(<xref ref="corollary-cayley-hamilton-max-nilpotency" />),
<alert>we must have <m>A^{n-1} \ne \zerovec</m></alert>.
</p><p>
Note that condition <xref ref="equation-elem-nilpotent-concepts-transition-pattern" />
is enough to guarantee that all the other columns of <m>P</m> are nonzero,
since if
<me> \uvec{p}_j = A^{j-1} \uvec{p}_1 = \zerovec </me>
were true for some <m>j \lt n</m>, then
<me> A^{n-1} \uvec{p}_1 = A^{n-j} (A^{j-1} \uvec{p}_1) = \zerovec </me>
would be true as well.
<!--
But picking a <m>\uvec{p}_1</m> to satisfy
<xref ref="equation-elem-nilpotent-concepts-transition-pattern" />
is easy using the assumption that <m>A^{n-1} \ne \zerovec</m>.
By this assumption,
some column of <m>A^{n-1}</m> must be nonzero,
and so we may simply pick <m>\uvec{p}_1 = \uvec{e}_j</m>,
a standard basis vector corresponding to some nonzero column of <m>A^{n-1}</m>.
In that case,
<me> A^{n-1} \uvec{p}_1 = A^{n-1} \uvec{e}_j </me>
will be equal to that nonzero <m>\nth[j]</m> column of <m>A^{n-1}</m>.

<subsection xml:id="subsection-elem-nilpotent-concepts-cyclic">
<title>Cyclic subspaces</title>

<p>
In <xref ref="procedure-elem-nilpotent-concepts-max-nilp-elem-form" />,
for the transition matrix <m>P</m> to be invertible it must be true that the vectors
<me> \uvec{v}, A \uvec{v}, A^2 \uvec{v}, \dotsc, A^{n-1} \uvec{v} </me>
are linearly independent and so form a basis of <m>\R^n</m> (or <m>\C^n</m>, as appropriate).
It is reasonable to turn the <q>cyclic</q> pattern exhibited by these basis vectors into a general concept,
for all matrices instead of just for <em>nilpotent</em> ones.
</p><p>
Given an <m>n \times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
a subspace <m>W</m> of <m>\R^n</m> (or <m>\C^n</m>, as appropriate)
that can be described by a <q>cyclic</q> spanning set as
<me> W = \Span \{ \uvec{w}, A \uvec{w}, A^2 \uvec{w}, \dotsc \} </me>
is called an <term><m>A</m>-cyclic subspace</term>,
and the generating vector <m>\uvec{w}</m> is called an
<term><m>A</m>-cyclic vector</term> for <m>W</m>.
We will explore the theory of <m>A</m>-cyclic subspaces in
<xref ref="section-elem-nilpotent-theory" />,
but we will say a couple of things here.
</p><p>
First, being contained in a finite-dimensional space,
the infinite spanning set for <m>W</m> cannot be linarly independent.
So there will be a point in the sequence
<me> \uvec{w}, A \uvec{w}, A^2 \uvec{w}, \dotsc </me>
where <m>A^k \uvec{w}</m> is dependent with all the previous vectors,
and then we will have
<me> W = \Span \{ \uvec{w}, A \uvec{w}, A^2 \uvec{w}, \dotsc, A^{k-1} \uvec{w} \} </me>.
(See <xref ref="lemma-elem-nilpotent-cyclic-transition" />.)
</p><p>
Second, an <m>A</m>-cyclic subspace is always <m>A</m>-invariant.
Every vector in such a subspace <m>W</m> is a linear combination of the cyclic spanning vectors <m>A^j \uvec{w}</m>,
and multiplying such a linear combination by <m>A</m> will obviously still be a linear combination of those cyclic spanning vectors,
just with each power of <m>A</m> in the linear combination increased by one.
</p>
<warning><p>
	A subspace of <m>\R^n</m> (or <m>\C^n</m>, as appropriate)
	does not necessarily contain any <m>A</m>-cyclic vectors,
	even if it is <m>A</m>-invariant.
</p></warning>
