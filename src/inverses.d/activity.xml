		The number one is important in algebra, it lets us do things like

<activity xml:id="activity-inverses-intro-to-inverse">
	<introduction><p>
		In the preamble to <xref ref="activity-inverses-identity-matrix" />, there were two ingredients necessary to make the algebra work:
		<ul>
			<li>there is a special number <m>1</m> so that <m>1a=a</m> for all numbers <m>a</m>; and</li>
			<li>for a nonzero number like <m>5</m>, there is a <term>multiplicative inverse</term> <m>1/5</m> so that <m>(1/5)\cdot 5 = 1</m>.</li>
		</ul>
		Multiplicative inverses are very useful in algebra, so we would also like to have them in matrix algebra.
	</p></introduction>
	<task>
		<p>
		Consider <me>A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}0\amp-1\\1\amp2\end{array}\right]</me>.
		Can you determine <me>B = \begin{bmatrix}a \amp b\\c \amp d\end{bmatrix}</me> so that <m>BA = I</m>?
		If so, check that <m>AB = I</m> also.
		</p>
		<aside><p>
			Don't just guess at matrix <m>B</m>, use the definition of <term>matrix equality</term> applied to <m>BA</m> and <m>I</m> to set up equations and try to solve for unknown entries <m>a,b,c,d</m>.

		Consider <me>A = \begin{bmatrix}0 \amp 1\\0 \amp 0\end{bmatrix}.</me>
		Can you determine <me>B = \begin{bmatrix}a \amp b\\c \amp d\end{bmatrix}</me> so that <m>BA = I</m>?
	</p></task>
	<postlude>
		<p>
		The previous activity demonstrates that some square matrices have multiplicative inverses (<ie /> are <term>invertible</term><idx><h>invertible</h></idx>) and some do not (called <term>singular</term><idx><h>singular</h></idx> in this case). If square matrix <m>A</m> is invertible, write <m>\inv{A}</m> for its inverse. (But <em>never</em> write <m>1/A</m>!) This inverse is <em>defined</em> by its relationship to <m>A</m> and <m>I</m>: <m>\inv{A}</m> is the square matrix of the same size as <m>A</m> so that both <m>A\inv{A} = I</m> and <m>\inv{A}A = I</m> are true.
		</p>
		<aside><p>
		Do you understand why we must assert that <em>both</em> <m>A\inv{A} = I</m> and <m>\inv{A}A = I</m> are true in defining the inverse <m>\inv{A}</m>, not just one? Maybe look back at
		<xref ref="activity-matrix-ops-matrix-mult-order-matters" />.

		In the following, assume <m>A,B,C</m> are square <em>invertible</em> matrices, all of the same dimension, and assume that <m>k</m> is a nonzero scalar. Do <em>not</em> just look up the answers in the rest of this chapter, try to come up with them yourselves.

		What do you think is the inverse of <m>\inv{A}</m>? Explain. (Your justification should mention the identity matrix.)

		If we have a linear system <m>A\uvec{x}=\uvec{b}</m> with a square and invertible coefficient matrix <m>A</m>, we can use matrix algebra to solve the system instead of row reducing, by using <m>\inv{A}</m> to isolate <m>\uvec{x}</m>.
