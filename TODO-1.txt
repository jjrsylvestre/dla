* ASIDE WEIRDNESS:
... When asides are in a place they shouldn't be, they mess with the generation of the "quick links" down the left-hand side of the page.
INSTANCES:
  * cols space procedure
  * some other place that I can't remember now, see commits recent to 25 Jan 2021 

* Matrix-times-column as linear combination of columns:
  column on right overlaid on rows of matrix on left,
  instead of rows of matrix on left overlaid on column on right.
^^^^ honestly don't know what this is referring to any more
