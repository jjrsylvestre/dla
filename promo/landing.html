<div class="Content">

<p>
<a href="DLA/"><i>Discover Linear Algebra</i></a> is an open-access linear algebra textbook that uses a discovery-based approach to introduce students to this beautiful subject.
The philosophy of this treatment is to allow the undeniable core ideas and patterns of linear algebra to reveal themselves to the student.
</p>

<p>
Each chapter begins with a set of <i>guided-discovery</i> activities suitable for use as in-class group activities, as pre-class preparatory explorations, or for self-study.
The exposition in the remainder of each chapter reflects and expands upon these introductory explorations, beginning with an informal <i>Concepts</i> section, followed by a section of <i>Examples</i>, and ending with a more formal <i>Theory</i> section of theorems and proofs.
Please see the book's preface
(<a href="DLA/preface.html">two-semester version</a>; <a href="DLA1/preface.html">one-semester version</a>)
for a little more detail on the organization and pedagogical approach of the book.

<h2>Instructor Resources</h2>

<h4><a href="./resources/dla-pacing.html">Scheduling and Using <i>Discover Linear Algebra</i></a></h4>

<h4>Practise Problem Lists</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
I usually recommend <i>3,000 Solved Problems in Linear Algebra</i> (Lipschutz) as an inexpensive supplementary textbook for students to use as a source of solved practise problems.
The following page contains chapter-by-chapter lists of recommended practise problems from this supplementary text for the <a href="DLA1/">one-semester version of <i>Discover Linear Algebra: A first course in linear algebra</i>.
</p>
<p><a href="./resources/dla1-practise.html">Practise Problem Lists for DLA1</a></p>

<h4>WeBWorK Problem Sets</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
Chapter-by-chapter WeBWorK problem sets for the one-semester version of <i>Discover Linear Algebra</i>.
The problem sets are not balanced â€” some chapters have a lot of problems, some only a few.
The average is 8 problems per set.
This may seem low, but is based on the philosophy that large numbers of repetitive, algorithmic, calculation-based "drill" problems are best left as practise problems (see above).

</p>

<h4>Lecture Videos</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
During the pandemic I seized the opportunity to fully "flip" my linear algebra courses and recorded lecture videos for each chapter.
Note that these are intended to be watched <em>after</em> students have attempted the corresponding <i>Discovery Guide</i>.
