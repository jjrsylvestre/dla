## EDIT REASONS:
## 1. Change from vectors to points.
## 2. Add exhortation for the students to use their brains instead of a formula.

BEGIN_TEXT

Let \(\Pi\) be the plane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) that passes through the origin as well as through both the points \(P($x1,$x2,$x3)\) and \(Q($y1,$y2,$y3)\).
$PAR
Compute the distance \(d\) from the point \(R($v1,$v2,$v3)\) to the plane \(\Pi\).
$PAR
\(d=\) \{ans_rule(10)\}

$BBOLD NOTE: $EBOLD It is likely possible that you can find a formula on the internet or in another textbook that you can use to plug'n'chug your way to an answer quickly, and $BITALIC learn absolutely nothing $EITALIC in the process.

$BBOLD $BITALIC OR $EITALIC $EBOLD $BR
You could treat this problem as a little puzzle, where you must use the geometry of vectors, lines, and planes in
\(\mathbb{R}^3\) and the concepts of $BITALIC norm $EITALIC and $BITALIC orthogonal projection $EITALIC
to figure out a solution to the problem all on your own. Here's a tip: start by drawing a diagram! It's OK if
you're not sure how to plot points P, Q, and R in a diagram of 3-space. You can just put (almost) any four dots on
your page (one for the origin, and one each for P, Q, and R), and your diagram can be used to help you figure out the
problem.
