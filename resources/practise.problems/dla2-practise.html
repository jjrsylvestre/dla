(Keep in mind that chapter numbers are not uniformly in sync between the two versions of the textbook.)

			<span color="red">WARNING</span>&nbsp;
			The supplementary text reverses the designations of "old" and "new" basis from the usage in <i>Discover Linear Algebra</i>.
			That is, what <i>3000 Problems</i> calls "new" would be called "old" in <i>DLA</i>, and vice versa.
			Their point of view is based on the linear formulas in the solution to problem #13.1,
			whereas the point of view in <i>DLA</i> is based on matrix formula (i) in <i>3000 Problem</i>'s <em>Theorem 13.2</em>.
			<br>
			<b>§13.1 #13.3:</b>
			You don't need to use #13.2 as they do in their solution,
			you should set up an appropriate matrix and row reduce.
			<br>
			<b>§13.1 #13.7:</b>
			You don't need to use #13.6 as they do in their solution,

			instead change the instructions to "determine a basis for each eigenspace of the matrix."

<em>NOTE</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A number of these questions are follow-ups to problems listed above under Chapter 21.
In §16.3 in particular,
when a question refers to work from a problem in that previous list,
this is indicated in the list below by "<i>(see ...)</i>" after the question.

			<b>Notation:</b>
			<ul>
				<li> The supplementary textbook does not use bold letters to represent vectors as is done in <i>Discover Linear Algebra</i>. </li>
				<li>
					The supplementary textbook uses the variable \(t\) instead of \(\lambda\) for computing eigenvalues,
					and uses the notation \(\Delta t\) to mean the characteristic polynomial of a matrix.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<b>§16:</b>
			Replace any mention of "the field of scalars \(K\)" by the collection \(\mathbb{R}\) of real numbers (which act as scalars for us).
			Also, replace any occurrence of \(K^n\) by the collection \(\mathbb{R}^n\) of \(n\)-dimensional vectors.
